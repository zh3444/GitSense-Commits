# Activity Summary for 9/5/2025

## 10:21:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `model.py` file, focusing on refining the `predict_image_labels` function.  The initial version (9:08:56 AM) lacked robust logic for selecting the best prediction and used print statements for debugging.

Subsequent commits between 9:52:44 AM and 9:58:25 AM added intermediate steps to process prediction results using a pandas DataFrame, sorting by bounding box area, and filtering out predictions with the label "marker" or "Bullseye".  These steps were aimed at improving prediction selection, but were ultimately removed in favor of a simpler, more efficient approach.

The final, significant change occurred at 10:20:46 AM.  This revision removed the pandas DataFrame processing entirely. Instead, it directly computes bounding box areas from the `r.boxes.xyxy` output and selects the prediction with the largest area. This is a notable simplification and likely an optimization for speed and efficiency.  The changes between 10:20:46 AM and 10:21:29 AM are minor and don't introduce any functional changes.

Throughout the revisions, the `load_model` and helper functions (`_to_numpy_bgr`, `get_label_map`) remained unchanged, suggesting that the focus was solely on improving the core image prediction logic.  The consistent use of `ultralytics` YOLO library for model loading and prediction is evident.
