# Activity Summary for 9/5/2025

## 10:21:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `model.py` file, focusing on refining the `predict_image_labels` function.  The initial version (9:08:56 AM) lacked robust logic for selecting the best prediction and used print statements for debugging.

Subsequent commits between 9:52:44 AM and 9:58:25 AM added intermediate steps to process prediction results using a pandas DataFrame, sorting by bounding box area, and filtering out predictions with the label "marker" or "Bullseye".  These steps were aimed at improving prediction selection, but were ultimately removed in favor of a simpler, more efficient approach.

The final, significant change occurred at 10:20:46 AM.  This revision removed the pandas DataFrame processing entirely. Instead, it directly computes bounding box areas from the `r.boxes.xyxy` output and selects the prediction with the largest area. This is a notable simplification and likely an optimization for speed and efficiency.  The changes between 10:20:46 AM and 10:21:29 AM are minor and don't introduce any functional changes.

Throughout the revisions, the `load_model` and helper functions (`_to_numpy_bgr`, `get_label_map`) remained unchanged, suggesting that the focus was solely on improving the core image prediction logic.  The consistent use of `ultralytics` YOLO library for model loading and prediction is evident.


## 1:31:16 PM
The log shows three revisions of the `model.py` file, all on September 5th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: loading a YOLOv8 model, performing image inference, and returning the detection results.  The key changes are within the `predict_image_labels` function, specifically how it handles multiple detected objects.

The first version (10:25:30 AM) contains a simple filter within the `predict_image_labels` function. If more than one object is detected, it iterates through the detected objects and removes any labeled as "marker".


The second version (12:41:09 PM) refactors the multiple object filtering in `predict_image_labels`. Instead of removing "marker" objects iteratively, it uses NumPy array operations for a more efficient and concise implementation.  This improved the logic to more reliably handle the filtering of "marker" labels from the results.

The third version (12:48:40 PM) adds a print statement after the filtering step in `predict_image_labels`, outputting the labels after the "marker" objects have been removed (`print(f'result after filtering: {labels}')`). This is likely for debugging purposes, providing a more detailed view of the intermediate results during the filtering process.  No functional change beyond this logging was made.

The `load_model`, `_to_numpy_bgr`, and `get_label_map` functions remain unchanged across all revisions.  The primary focus of the updates is streamlining and enhancing the object filtering within the image prediction process.
