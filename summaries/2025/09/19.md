# Activity Summary for 9/19/2025

## 9:19:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Week8.py` file between 8:34 AM and 9:13 AM on September 19, 2025.  The code is for a Raspberry Pi (RPI) server that interacts with an Android app and an STM (likely a microcontroller) via serial communication.  No significant code changes are apparent across these revisions; all observed changes appear to be minor formatting or whitespace differences.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout the log entries.  The code handles image capture using a PiCamera, processes commands from the Android app (specifically 'sendArena' and 'stm' commands), and sends commands to the STM via serial communication using the `STMLink` class.  Image processing involves converting the raw image into a JPEG and saving it locally, with error handling for various scenarios like connection drops, encoding failures, and file writing issues. The Android communication involves a separate process (`android_io_process`) with threads for sending and receiving messages using JSON.  The `rpi_action_queue` manages commands for image capture ("snap") and robot control ("control").  There is a commented-out section related to stitching (`# elif command.get_cat == 'stitch'`), suggesting potential future development.  The use of `Manager()` from the `multiprocessing` module indicates a focus on inter-process communication and data sharing.


## 1:34:57 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `Week8.py` file within the `RPI_Server` directory, alongside a single update to the `model.py` file in the `RPI_Vision` directory.

**`model.py` (9/19/2025, 9:29:57 AM):** This file contains functions related to object detection using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model.  Key functions include `load_model` (loads a YOLOv8 model, optionally performing a warmup), `_to_numpy_bgr` (converts various image sources into a NumPy array in BGR format), `get_label_map` (extracts the label map from the model), and `predict_image_labels` (performs inference on an image and returns the label and bounding box of the object with the largest area, filtering out objects labeled 'marker' if multiple objects are detected).  The code is well-structured, using type hints and comprehensive error handling.

**`Week8.py` (Multiple Revisions):** This file is a Raspberry Pi server script.  The main class `RaspberryPi` manages interactions between an Android app, an STM32 microcontroller, and a camera.  Significant changes occurred throughout the day:

* **Early Revisions (9/19/2025, 9:32:45 AM - 9:37:38 AM):**  These revisions focused on establishing the core structure of the `RaspberryPi` class, including initialization of queues, events, and hardware interfaces (camera, STM link, and Android link).  The `take_snapshot` function shows robust error handling during image capture and JPEG encoding, including creating temporary files and implementing proper cleanup.  Initially, both STM and Android communication were included; however, the STM related methods were progressively commented out.  The Android communication logic was developed in stages.  A `test_android` function for simulating Android messages was also added and later removed.

* **Revisions Focusing on Android Communication (9/19/2025, 10:30:26 AM - 11:11:51 AM):** These commits centered on improving the Android message handling in the `recv_android` function. Initially, a simple `json.loads()` was used, but due to issues with single quotes, a `replace` function was introduced to replace single quotes with double quotes before JSON parsing.  Further changes involved additional parsing of the 'value' field within the received JSON messages,  utilizing `ast.literal_eval` to handle nested JSON structures received from the Android app.  The changes involved adding more logging statements and error handling.  The `test_android` function is partially visible in some commits and subsequently removed.

* **Final Revisions (9/19/2025, 12:38:38 PM - 1:33:05 PM):**  The final changes focused on refining the Android message processing within `recv_android`.  The use of `ast.literal_eval` was improved to properly handle the nested JSON structures received from Android.  `json.loads` is also used for further robust error handling and to allow nested JSON to be parsed.  The overall goal of these revisions appears to be handling the complexity and potential errors in receiving and processing messages from the Android app, making the system more robust in handling varying JSON structures sent by the Android application.


In summary, the `model.py` file provides object detection capabilities. The `Week8.py` file underwent extensive development throughout the day, mainly focusing on robustly handling Android communication, particularly improving the parsing and error handling of potentially malformed JSON messages from the Android app. STM communication was initially implemented but later removed from the active codebase. The camera functionality remained consistent throughout, capturing and saving images with error handling.
