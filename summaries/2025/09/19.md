# Activity Summary for 9/19/2025

## 9:19:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Week8.py` file between 8:34 AM and 9:13 AM on September 19, 2025.  The code is for a Raspberry Pi (RPI) server that interacts with an Android app and an STM (likely a microcontroller) via serial communication.  No significant code changes are apparent across these revisions; all observed changes appear to be minor formatting or whitespace differences.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout the log entries.  The code handles image capture using a PiCamera, processes commands from the Android app (specifically 'sendArena' and 'stm' commands), and sends commands to the STM via serial communication using the `STMLink` class.  Image processing involves converting the raw image into a JPEG and saving it locally, with error handling for various scenarios like connection drops, encoding failures, and file writing issues. The Android communication involves a separate process (`android_io_process`) with threads for sending and receiving messages using JSON.  The `rpi_action_queue` manages commands for image capture ("snap") and robot control ("control").  There is a commented-out section related to stitching (`# elif command.get_cat == 'stitch'`), suggesting potential future development.  The use of `Manager()` from the `multiprocessing` module indicates a focus on inter-process communication and data sharing.
