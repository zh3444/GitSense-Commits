# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 5:12:34 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `Week8.py`, a Python script likely controlling a robot.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be refining the communication and control logic between the script, an Android device, and an STM (likely a microcontroller).

The initial version (9/25/2025, 2:41:19 PM) establishes the core framework:  It initializes communication links with Android (via Bluetooth) and STM, uses multiple queues for managing commands and responses, and handles camera functions (assuming a Raspberry Pi environment).  The code includes functions for sending commands to the STM, receiving data from Android, and uploading images to an `IMAGE_SERVER` for processing by an `ALGO_SERVER`.  The `ALGO_SERVER` responds with new path commands for the STM.  The "A5" related code suggests specific features for a particular robot model.

Subsequent changes (between 2:41:19 PM and 4:48:06 PM) show several minor edits with no substantial code alterations, focusing mainly on adding logging statements for debugging purposes and minor structural adjustments.  One notable exception is the addition of a lock around the `stm_link.send(cmd)` call in `send_and_wait` (around 3:42 PM), which improves thread safety. Another change is the addition of `self.stm_queue.put("SNAPS")` within the `rpi_queue_listener` at around 3:01 PM, suggesting a change in how image capture is triggered.  The removal of a thread (around 3:19 PM), originally for "A5", indicates potential cleanup or simplification of A5-specific functionality.

Finally,  the code remains largely consistent throughout these edits; the core functionality of communication, command processing, and path planning does not undergo significant changes.   The focus is primarily on improving robustness and adding logging features, suggesting iterative debugging and refinement rather than fundamental code restructuring.  The final commit at 5:02 PM shows no significant change compared to the previous commit.

The `helper.py` file (9/25/2025, 5:11:01 PM) contains helper functions related to coordinate conversion and path tracking. It shows functions to convert direction representations between different systems and to track robot coordinates based on pathfinding algorithm states or simple command execution. This file likely assists with integrating the path planning from the `ALGO_SERVER` with the robot's physical movement.  This suggests the integration of an external path planning algorithm and the handling of its output.
