# Activity Summary for 9/13/2025

## 3:47:48 PM
The log shows iterative development of a Python script (`Week8.py`) handling communication between a Raspberry Pi and an Android device.  The script uses multiprocessing for concurrent tasks.

The initial versions (9/13/2025, 2:49:24 PM and 2:49:45 PM) primarily focused on receiving obstacle information from Android and establishing a basic Android connection with error handling for disconnections and reconnections.  The `recv_android` function received messages and put them into a queue.  The code contained several TODO comments indicating planned integration of STM32 communication and algorithm endpoints.

A significant update occurred at 9/13/2025, 3:32:01 PM and 3:32:06 PM.  This revision enhanced message handling by adding input validation to check message format, handling  `'sendArena'` messages (presumably for setting the arena obstacles), and adding support for `'stm'` messages (likely joystick commands from the Android device). The log level for error messages was changed from `info` to `error` and the key changed from `obstacles` to `value`.

The final changes (9/13/2025, 3:39:06 PM and 3:39:18 PM) introduced a `send_android` function and a corresponding process to send messages back to the Android device. This adds bidirectional communication, enabling periodic updates from the Raspberry Pi to Android. Minor logging level changes from `error` to `debug` were introduced in these last two updates as well.  The overall structure remained consistent throughout the updates, with the primary focus on refining message handling, error checking and adding sending capabilities.
