# Activity Summary for 9/13/2025

## 3:47:48 PM
The log shows iterative development of a Python script (`Week8.py`) handling communication between a Raspberry Pi and an Android device.  The script uses multiprocessing for concurrent tasks.

The initial versions (9/13/2025, 2:49:24 PM and 2:49:45 PM) primarily focused on receiving obstacle information from Android and establishing a basic Android connection with error handling for disconnections and reconnections.  The `recv_android` function received messages and put them into a queue.  The code contained several TODO comments indicating planned integration of STM32 communication and algorithm endpoints.

A significant update occurred at 9/13/2025, 3:32:01 PM and 3:32:06 PM.  This revision enhanced message handling by adding input validation to check message format, handling  `'sendArena'` messages (presumably for setting the arena obstacles), and adding support for `'stm'` messages (likely joystick commands from the Android device). The log level for error messages was changed from `info` to `error` and the key changed from `obstacles` to `value`.

The final changes (9/13/2025, 3:39:06 PM and 3:39:18 PM) introduced a `send_android` function and a corresponding process to send messages back to the Android device. This adds bidirectional communication, enabling periodic updates from the Raspberry Pi to Android. Minor logging level changes from `error` to `debug` were introduced in these last two updates as well.  The overall structure remained consistent throughout the updates, with the primary focus on refining message handling, error checking and adding sending capabilities.


## 4:47:48 PM
The log shows a single file, `Week8.py`, undergoing several revisions between 3:47 PM and 4:44 PM on September 13, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: a Raspberry Pi server communicating with an Android device and potentially an STM32 microcontroller (though STM32 integration is marked as TODO).  Communication uses queues managed by `multiprocessing.Manager`.

The initial version (3:47 PM) establishes the basic framework for receiving commands from Android (`recv_android`) and sending updates (`send_android`).  It handles `'sendArena'` messages (obstacle data) and `'stm'` messages (joystick commands).

Subsequent revisions (4:09 PM, 4:10 PM, 4:20 PM, 4:20 PM, 4:29 PM, 4:34 PM, and 4:44 PM) primarily focus on adding a `test_android` function. This function periodically sends test messages to the Android queue, simulating image recognition data, location updates, stitched images, and status reports.  The most significant change is making the `test_android` function run continuously, and  sending  messages to the android queue,  and then making a call to the `test_android()` from within the `send_android()` function between 4:20 PM and 4:34 PM. A minor change around 4:44 PM improved exception handling in the `send_android` function.  The `test_android` function simulates various message types to the Android device at intervals of approximately 3 seconds.  Throughout the revisions, the core structure of the Android communication remains unchanged; only the addition and slight modification of the testing function are evident.


## 10:50:58 PM
The file `Week8.py` defines a `RaspberryPi` class managing communication between a Raspberry Pi, an Android device, and potentially an STM32 microcontroller (though STM32 integration is marked as TODO).  The code uses multiprocessing for concurrent operations, with separate processes for receiving and sending messages to Android.

Key features include:

* **Inter-process communication:**  Utilizes `multiprocessing.Queue` and `Manager` to handle message passing between processes. Queues manage Android-to-RPI commands (`android_queue`), RPI actions (`rpi_action_queue`), and messages to the STM32 (`stm_queue`).  A `path_queue` is also present, likely for planned path management.
* **Android Communication:**  The `AndroidLink` class handles communication with an Android device. Error handling (OSError and reconnections) is implemented in `recv_android` and `reconnect_android`.  Messages received from Android are parsed as JSON and categorized based on their `cat` field (e.g., 'sendArena', 'stm').  A `test_android` function sends random test messages to simulate various data streams (image recognition, location, stitched images, status).
* **Action Handling:** `PiAction` class encapsulates actions for the RPI, categorized as info, error, location, image recognition, status, obstacle, and control.  The main logic for handling these actions within the `recv_android` function is currently incomplete (TODOs are present).
* **Obstacle Handling:**  The code includes data structures (`success_obstacles_list`, `failed_obstacles_list`) for managing obstacles, implying obstacle avoidance or navigation functionality.  The integration with path planning based on obstacle information is also incomplete.
* **Timestamp:** The code was last modified on September 13th, 2025, at 4:55:38 PM.


The code is largely focused on setting up the communication infrastructure, with significant portions (particularly action handling and algorithm integration) still under development.  The use of multiprocessing and robust error handling for the Android connection suggest a system designed for reliable, real-time operation.
