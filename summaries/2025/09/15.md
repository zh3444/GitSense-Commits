# Activity Summary for 9/15/2025

## 11:16:39 AM
The code logs show development of a Raspberry Pi server for a robotics application, focusing on communication with Android and potentially an STM32 device.

**`link.py` (9/15/2025, 10:26 AM & 10:27 AM):** This file defines an abstract base class `Link` for communication, with methods `send` and `recv`.  The second revision adds an `__init__` method initializing a logger.  This suggests a refactoring to incorporate logging consistently.

**`spp_server.py` (9/15/2025, 10:31 AM - 10:51 AM):** This file implements a Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP) server using the `bluetooth` library.  The `AndroidLink` class handles connection, sending (`send`), and receiving (`recv`) messages using a custom `AndroidMessage` class for structured data.  The initial version uses `print` statements for logging.  Subsequent revisions (10:34 AM and 10:35 AM) replace `print` statements with calls to `self.logger.info` and `self.logger.error`, indicating the integration of logging functionality. The final revision (10:51 AM) removed the commented out `logger` import.

**`Week8.py` (9/15/2025, 11:04 AM):** This file is the main Raspberry Pi application. It uses multiprocessing and threading for concurrent tasks:

*   **Android Communication:** Manages communication with an Android device using the `AndroidLink` from `spp_server.py`. It utilizes threads for sending and receiving messages concurrently.  Error handling is present to manage connection drops and invalid messages.  Includes a `reconnect_android` function for robust connection management. A test function (`test_android`) sends random messages to the Android device for testing purposes.
*   **RPI Action Queue:** The `rpi_action_queue` processes commands, such as obstacle information (`sendArena`) and control commands (`stm`) from the Android app.
*   **Multiprocessing:** Uses multiple processes (`android_listener`, etc.) to handle different aspects of the system. A `rpi_queue_process` function is designed to handle commands from the RPI queue.

Recurring elements across the log include error handling (`try...except` blocks) and logging improvements (switching from `print` to logger functions). The overall structure is evolving from a basic implementation to a more robust and structured application using multiprocessing and improved logging.
