# Activity Summary for 9/15/2025

## 11:16:39 AM
The code logs show development of a Raspberry Pi server for a robotics application, focusing on communication with Android and potentially an STM32 device.

**`link.py` (9/15/2025, 10:26 AM & 10:27 AM):** This file defines an abstract base class `Link` for communication, with methods `send` and `recv`.  The second revision adds an `__init__` method initializing a logger.  This suggests a refactoring to incorporate logging consistently.

**`spp_server.py` (9/15/2025, 10:31 AM - 10:51 AM):** This file implements a Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP) server using the `bluetooth` library.  The `AndroidLink` class handles connection, sending (`send`), and receiving (`recv`) messages using a custom `AndroidMessage` class for structured data.  The initial version uses `print` statements for logging.  Subsequent revisions (10:34 AM and 10:35 AM) replace `print` statements with calls to `self.logger.info` and `self.logger.error`, indicating the integration of logging functionality. The final revision (10:51 AM) removed the commented out `logger` import.

**`Week8.py` (9/15/2025, 11:04 AM):** This file is the main Raspberry Pi application. It uses multiprocessing and threading for concurrent tasks:

*   **Android Communication:** Manages communication with an Android device using the `AndroidLink` from `spp_server.py`. It utilizes threads for sending and receiving messages concurrently.  Error handling is present to manage connection drops and invalid messages.  Includes a `reconnect_android` function for robust connection management. A test function (`test_android`) sends random messages to the Android device for testing purposes.
*   **RPI Action Queue:** The `rpi_action_queue` processes commands, such as obstacle information (`sendArena`) and control commands (`stm`) from the Android app.
*   **Multiprocessing:** Uses multiple processes (`android_listener`, etc.) to handle different aspects of the system. A `rpi_queue_process` function is designed to handle commands from the RPI queue.

Recurring elements across the log include error handling (`try...except` blocks) and logging improvements (switching from `print` to logger functions). The overall structure is evolving from a basic implementation to a more robust and structured application using multiprocessing and improved logging.


## 12:16:38 PM
The Python script `Week8.py` implements a Raspberry Pi server for coordinating actions between an Android device, an STM32 microcontroller (STM), and a robot.  The code uses multiprocessing and threading extensively.  Key features include:

* **Inter-process Communication (IPC):**  `Manager` objects from the `multiprocessing` library are used to create shared queues (`android_queue`, `rpi_action_queue`, `stm_queue`, `path_queue`) for communication between processes.  `Event` objects (`android_stop_event`) handle process synchronization.

* **Android Communication:** An `AndroidLink` class manages communication with an Android device.  A dedicated process (`android_io_process`) handles both sending and receiving messages using separate threads (`send_android`, `recv_android`).  The `recv_android` thread parses JSON messages from Android, identifying message categories (`'sendArena'`, `'stm'`) to trigger appropriate actions.  A `reconnect_android` function handles reconnection attempts.  A temporary `test_android` function sends test messages to the Android queue.

* **Action Handling:**  The `PiAction` class represents actions, categorized by type (`info`, `error`, `location`, `image rec`, `status`, `obstacle`, `control`). A `rpi_queue_process` function processes actions from the `rpi_action_queue`.

* **Robot Control:** The code includes placeholders for STM32 integration and algorithm endpoints (marked with `TODO`).  A `movement_lock` is used for thread safety when updating robot location.  Obstacle handling is partially implemented, using shared dictionaries (`obstacles`, `success_obstacles_list`, `failed_obstacles_list`).

* **Logging:** The `prepare_logger` function (from an external `logger` module) is used for logging.

The code is heavily reliant on asynchronous operations and error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks for network issues and JSON parsing).  A significant portion of the code is marked with `TODO`, indicating incomplete integration with STM32, algorithm endpoints, and full obstacle handling.  The timestamp of the log entry is September 15th, 2025, at 12:10:25 PM.
