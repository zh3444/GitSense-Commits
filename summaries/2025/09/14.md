# Activity Summary for 9/14/2025

## 2:05:10 PM
The log shows three revisions of the file `c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Server\communication\spp_server.py` within a short time frame (approximately 20 minutes on September 14, 2025).  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions: establishing a Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP) server connection with an Android device, sending and receiving JSON-formatted messages.

The key changes are related to logging:

* **Initial Version (1:03:17 PM):**  Print statements are used for logging connection status and error handling.
* **Second Revision (1:03:57 PM):**  The `AndroidMessage` class is modified to include a logger instance (`self.logger = prepare_logger()`), and all print statements are replaced with calls to the logger for both informational and error messages.  This is a significant improvement for debugging and monitoring.
* **Third Revision (1:04:30 PM):** The logger instantiation is moved from the `AndroidMessage` class to the `AndroidLink` class.  This is a minor change, logically placing the logger with the class responsible for the Bluetooth connection.

No other significant code changes are observed across the three versions.  The Bluetooth connection setup, message handling (sending and receiving), and error handling remain largely the same. The pattern shows a progressive improvement in the code's logging mechanism, replacing basic print statements with a more robust logging framework.
