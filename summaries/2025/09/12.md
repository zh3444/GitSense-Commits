# Activity Summary for 9/12/2025

## 10:30:22 AM
The log shows development on an RPI server for a mobile robot project.  The primary changes involve establishing communication between a Raspberry Pi (RPI), an Android device, and potentially an STM32 microcontroller (though STM32 integration is marked as TODO).

`Week8.py` (9/12/2025, 9:33:58 AM) defines the core RPI logic.  This file introduces classes for managing actions (`PiAction`), the RPI itself (`RaspberryPi`), and handling communication queues using `multiprocessing.Manager`.  The `RaspberryPi` class sets up queues for Android messages, RPI actions, and STM32 messages. It also includes functions for receiving Android messages (`recv_android`), reconnecting to Android (`reconnect_android`), and a placeholder for requesting algorithm execution (`request_algo`).  The primary focus is receiving obstacle data from the Android device and placing it in a queue for processing.  Error handling and reconnection mechanisms are implemented for the Android connection.


`communication\spp_server.py` (9/12/2025, 10:21:16 AM) details the Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP) server implementation.  This file defines classes `AndroidMessage` for structuring messages and `AndroidLink` for managing the Bluetooth connection.  `AndroidLink` includes functions for connecting, disconnecting, sending, and receiving messages using Bluetooth sockets. Error handling is present for both sending and receiving. The code uses the classic SPP UUID ("00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB").  The update focuses on robust error handling and clear message formatting for Android communication.

The overall pattern shows a system design focusing on asynchronous communication and modularity. The use of queues suggests a concurrent architecture. Significant progress is made on the Android communication layer, while STM32 and algorithm integration are left for future development.
