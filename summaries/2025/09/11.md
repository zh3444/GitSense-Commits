# Activity Summary for 9/11/2025

## 11:09:52 AM
The log shows two commits to `Week8.py` on September 11th, 2025.  The first commit (10:40:40 AM) establishes the basic structure of a Raspberry Pi server application, including classes for handling actions (`PiAction`) and managing the Raspberry Pi's interactions with Android and potentially an STM32 device (indicated by TODO comments).  It defines queues for communication and methods for receiving messages from Android.  A `reconnect_android` function is outlined but not fully implemented.

The second commit (10:52:04 AM) adds a crucial piece of functionality: the creation and starting of an `android_listener` process using `multiprocessing.Process`. This process executes the `recv_android` function, actively listening for Android messages.  The main `start` function now includes this process initiation and logs its start.  No other code changes were made.  The overall pattern shows a progressive development of the Android communication aspect of the Raspberry Pi server, moving from a basic framework to an active multi-process architecture.
