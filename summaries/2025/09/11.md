# Activity Summary for 9/11/2025

## 11:09:52 AM
The log shows two commits to `Week8.py` on September 11th, 2025.  The first commit (10:40:40 AM) establishes the basic structure of a Raspberry Pi server application, including classes for handling actions (`PiAction`) and managing the Raspberry Pi's interactions with Android and potentially an STM32 device (indicated by TODO comments).  It defines queues for communication and methods for receiving messages from Android.  A `reconnect_android` function is outlined but not fully implemented.

The second commit (10:52:04 AM) adds a crucial piece of functionality: the creation and starting of an `android_listener` process using `multiprocessing.Process`. This process executes the `recv_android` function, actively listening for Android messages.  The main `start` function now includes this process initiation and logs its start.  No other code changes were made.  The overall pattern shows a progressive development of the Android communication aspect of the Raspberry Pi server, moving from a basic framework to an active multi-process architecture.


## 8:49:11 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `spp_server.py` file between 8:32 PM and 8:41 PM on September 11, 2025.  The file implements a Bluetooth SPP server using Python's `bluetooth` library.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout the revisions: establishing a Bluetooth connection, sending and receiving JSON-formatted messages (`AndroidMessage` class), and handling potential errors.

The primary changes across the revisions involve the explicit use of the `bluetooth` module for constants and functions.  Initially, some elements like `PORT_ANY`, `SERIAL_PORT_CLASS`, `SERIAL_PORT_PROFILE`, and `SHUT_RDWR` were used without explicit module qualification (e.g., `PORT_ANY` instead of `bluetooth.PORT_ANY`).  Subsequent revisions progressively corrected this, culminating in the final version at 8:41 PM where all these elements are properly qualified with `bluetooth`.  This improves code clarity and avoids potential naming conflicts.  The change in `shutdown` arguments from `socket.SHUT_RDWR` to `bluetooth.SHUT_RDWR` is another example of this improvement.  No significant changes to the core logic or message handling are observed throughout these edits.
