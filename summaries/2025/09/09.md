# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 11:29:12 AM
The log shows iterative development of a computer vision system involving a Raspberry Pi (RPI).  The primary files are `model.py` and `server_receive_image.py`, with `client_send_image.py` handling image capture and transmission.

**`model.py` (9/9/2025):** This file underwent several revisions between 10:43 AM and 10:53 AM. The core functionality remained consistent: loading a YOLOv8 model (`load_model`), converting image sources to NumPy arrays (`_to_numpy_bgr`), obtaining the label map (`get_label_map`), and predicting image labels (`predict_image_labels`).  The key change involved enhancing the logging in `predict_image_labels` with informative `[INFO]` and `[WARN]` messages. The initial version had basic `print()` statements. Subsequent versions improved these by prepending informative tags, making debugging easier. The `TODO` comments ("implement robust logic", "refine logic") suggest ongoing development to improve the accuracy and robustness of the prediction logic.

**`server_receive_image.py` (9/9/2025):** This Flask-based server received updates between 11:04 AM and 11:14 AM. The major changes involved adding more informative logging using `[INFO]` statements to indicate successful image saving and annotation.  The earlier versions contained less descriptive print statements. Another minor change involved the restructuring of the `import` statements for better code organization. The `TODO` comments highlight planned features such as client-side endpoints for retrieving annotations and stitching images.

**`client_send_image.py` (9/9/2025):**  This file was modified between 11:16 AM and 11:24 AM.  The improvements focused on robust error handling and clearer logging in the `capture_jpeg` function. The initial version had simple `print()` statements. Later updates replaced them with `[INFO]` and `[ERROR]` messages, particularly around local image saving.  Error handling was also improved by adding more specific error messages during file saving. The core functionality of capturing images using a PiCamera, encoding them as JPEGs, and sending them to the server remained unchanged.
