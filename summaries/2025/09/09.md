# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 11:29:12 AM
The log shows iterative development of a computer vision system involving a Raspberry Pi (RPI).  The primary files are `model.py` and `server_receive_image.py`, with `client_send_image.py` handling image capture and transmission.

**`model.py` (9/9/2025):** This file underwent several revisions between 10:43 AM and 10:53 AM. The core functionality remained consistent: loading a YOLOv8 model (`load_model`), converting image sources to NumPy arrays (`_to_numpy_bgr`), obtaining the label map (`get_label_map`), and predicting image labels (`predict_image_labels`).  The key change involved enhancing the logging in `predict_image_labels` with informative `[INFO]` and `[WARN]` messages. The initial version had basic `print()` statements. Subsequent versions improved these by prepending informative tags, making debugging easier. The `TODO` comments ("implement robust logic", "refine logic") suggest ongoing development to improve the accuracy and robustness of the prediction logic.

**`server_receive_image.py` (9/9/2025):** This Flask-based server received updates between 11:04 AM and 11:14 AM. The major changes involved adding more informative logging using `[INFO]` statements to indicate successful image saving and annotation.  The earlier versions contained less descriptive print statements. Another minor change involved the restructuring of the `import` statements for better code organization. The `TODO` comments highlight planned features such as client-side endpoints for retrieving annotations and stitching images.

**`client_send_image.py` (9/9/2025):**  This file was modified between 11:16 AM and 11:24 AM.  The improvements focused on robust error handling and clearer logging in the `capture_jpeg` function. The initial version had simple `print()` statements. Later updates replaced them with `[INFO]` and `[ERROR]` messages, particularly around local image saving.  Error handling was also improved by adding more specific error messages during file saving. The core functionality of capturing images using a PiCamera, encoding them as JPEGs, and sending them to the server remained unchanged.


## 12:29:12 PM
The log shows development activity across several Python files within the `RPI_Vision` and `RPI_Server` directories.  The most significant changes involve `client_send_image.py`, focusing on image capture, JPEG encoding, and HTTP uploads to a server.

**`client_send_image.py` (Multiple Revisions):** This file underwent several revisions between 11:29 AM and 11:31 AM. The key changes are error handling improvements in the upload and image capture sections. Initially, only generic error messages were logged.  Later revisions provide more informative error messages, including the specific error from `result['message']` when capture fails and more explicit error reporting for upload failures.  The core functionality of capturing images from a Raspberry Pi camera, encoding them as JPEGs, and sending them to a server using `requests.post` remained consistent throughout.


**`draw_bounding_box.py` (Single Revision):** This utility function, added at 11:40 AM, takes image data and bounding box coordinates as input and draws a bounding box with a label on the provided image.  It uses OpenCV (`cv2`) for drawing operations.

**`send_annotated_images.py` (Multiple Revisions):** This file was modified several times between 11:42 AM and 11:44 AM.  The changes are minor, primarily involving the removal of unnecessary imports (`PIL`, `ImageOps`, `BytesIO`). The core function, which zips images from a results folder and sends them as a zip file using Flask's `send_file`, remained unchanged.

**`stitch_images.py` (Two Revisions):** This file, updated between 11:45 AM and 11:52 AM, stitches multiple JPEG images together into a single image.  The primary change was updating a print statement from `print()` to `print(f'[WARN] ...')`, indicating a shift towards more descriptive logging. The core image stitching logic, which involves loading images, padding them to a uniform size, arranging them in a grid, and returning a stitched JPEG, remained mostly the same.

**`logger.py` (Single Revision):** This file, added at 12:12 PM, provides a function to set up a logger that writes to both the console and a log file ("logfile.txt"). It prevents adding duplicate handlers if the logger already has some.

**`Week8.py` (Single Revision):** This file, added at 12:15 PM, appears to be setting up a class structure for managing actions (presumably related to the Raspberry Pi). The code is incomplete; it shows a `PiAction` class and imports suggesting integration with multiple systems (Android, STM32) and algorithm endpoints are planned for future development.  It also uses the logger defined in `logger.py`.

In summary, the codebase demonstrates work on a system that captures images, processes them (drawing bounding boxes), compiles results, and sends data to a server.  The majority of changes focused on enhancing error handling and logging within the image capture and transmission components.  The `Week8.py` file hints at a broader, more integrated system planned for future development.


## 3:07:44 PM
The log shows modifications to `c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Server\Week8.py`.  The file's initial commit (9/9/2025, 12:51:50 PM) contains basic Python imports, definition of a `PiAction` class (with `get_cat` and `get_value` properties), and a `RaspberryPi` class with a logger.  A subsequent update (9/9/2025, 2:26:24 PM) adds a comment within the `PiAction` class's `__init__` method, specifying that the `cat` parameter can include values like "info", "error", "location", "image rec", "status", "obstacle", and "control".  No other functional changes are apparent; the core structure remains unchanged.  The modifications primarily involve clarifying the purpose of the `cat` parameter.
