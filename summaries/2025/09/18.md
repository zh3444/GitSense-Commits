# Activity Summary for 9/18/2025

## 11:18:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of two Python files (`Week8.py` and `server_receive_image.py`) and an `.env` file.  The changes primarily focus on the `Week8.py` file, which appears to be a Raspberry Pi server managing communication with an Android device and an STM32 microcontroller.

`server_receive_image.py` (Image Recognition Server): This file remained largely unchanged across the log entries. It defines Flask endpoints for image upload (`/upload`), status check (`/status`), and  placeholder endpoints for annotation retrieval (`/retrieve_annotations`) and image stitching (`/stitch_images`). The `/upload` endpoint receives images, performs object detection using a loaded model, draws bounding boxes on detected objects, and saves the annotated image.

`Week8.py` (RPi Server): This file underwent significant changes between the first entry (9/18/2025, 10:33:47 AM) and subsequent entries.  The most notable changes include:

* **Initial Version (10:33:47 AM):** The initial version included extensive multi-threaded/multi-processing code for managing communication with Android and the STM32 using queues and events. It features a camera capture and image upload mechanism.  It contains placeholder comments (`TODO`) indicating future integrations.  The primary communication mechanism seemed to be based on `AndroidLink` (later removed). A `test_android` function simulates Android messages for testing.

* **STM32 Integration (10:51:42 AM, 10:57:27 AM):**  Subsequent revisions removed the `AndroidLink` and introduced `STMLink` for STM32 communication. The code now includes a `send_and_wait` function for reliable STM32 command execution and response handling using events, showing a shift in focus towards STM32 interaction. A check `IS_RPI` is added to handle cases where the code runs on a non-Raspberry Pi environment.

* **Image Server URL Update (11:01:15 AM, 11:04:13 AM, 11:09:56 AM, 11:10:10 AM):**  The code was modified to use environment variables from the `.env` file to set the image server URL. This environment variable's name changed from `SERVER` to `IMAGE_SERVER`, indicating better organization and clarity.  Multiple near-identical revisions of `Week8.py` suggest iterative debugging or minor adjustments.


In summary, the code evolved from a primarily Android-focused server to one prioritizing STM32 communication, incorporating error handling and robustness improvements, and using environment variables for configuration.  The image processing pipeline involves capturing images on the Raspberry Pi, uploading them to a separate image recognition server (`IMAGE_SERVER`), and then sending the results back to the Android device.  The `.env` file consistently defines environment variables for image and algorithm servers.
