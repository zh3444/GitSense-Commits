# Activity Summary for 9/18/2025

## 11:18:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of two Python files (`Week8.py` and `server_receive_image.py`) and an `.env` file.  The changes primarily focus on the `Week8.py` file, which appears to be a Raspberry Pi server managing communication with an Android device and an STM32 microcontroller.

`server_receive_image.py` (Image Recognition Server): This file remained largely unchanged across the log entries. It defines Flask endpoints for image upload (`/upload`), status check (`/status`), and  placeholder endpoints for annotation retrieval (`/retrieve_annotations`) and image stitching (`/stitch_images`). The `/upload` endpoint receives images, performs object detection using a loaded model, draws bounding boxes on detected objects, and saves the annotated image.

`Week8.py` (RPi Server): This file underwent significant changes between the first entry (9/18/2025, 10:33:47 AM) and subsequent entries.  The most notable changes include:

* **Initial Version (10:33:47 AM):** The initial version included extensive multi-threaded/multi-processing code for managing communication with Android and the STM32 using queues and events. It features a camera capture and image upload mechanism.  It contains placeholder comments (`TODO`) indicating future integrations.  The primary communication mechanism seemed to be based on `AndroidLink` (later removed). A `test_android` function simulates Android messages for testing.

* **STM32 Integration (10:51:42 AM, 10:57:27 AM):**  Subsequent revisions removed the `AndroidLink` and introduced `STMLink` for STM32 communication. The code now includes a `send_and_wait` function for reliable STM32 command execution and response handling using events, showing a shift in focus towards STM32 interaction. A check `IS_RPI` is added to handle cases where the code runs on a non-Raspberry Pi environment.

* **Image Server URL Update (11:01:15 AM, 11:04:13 AM, 11:09:56 AM, 11:10:10 AM):**  The code was modified to use environment variables from the `.env` file to set the image server URL. This environment variable's name changed from `SERVER` to `IMAGE_SERVER`, indicating better organization and clarity.  Multiple near-identical revisions of `Week8.py` suggest iterative debugging or minor adjustments.


In summary, the code evolved from a primarily Android-focused server to one prioritizing STM32 communication, incorporating error handling and robustness improvements, and using environment variables for configuration.  The image processing pipeline involves capturing images on the Raspberry Pi, uploading them to a separate image recognition server (`IMAGE_SERVER`), and then sending the results back to the Android device.  The `.env` file consistently defines environment variables for image and algorithm servers.


## 12:18:19 PM
The `Week8.py` file, last updated on 9/18/2025 at 11:53:19 AM, is a Python script for a Raspberry Pi (RPI) application.  The code manages communication with an Android device and an STM (likely a microcontroller) via custom `STMLink` and (commented-out) `AndroidLink` classes. It also handles image capture using `PiCamera` (if available) and uploads images to an image server specified by an environment variable.

Key updates include:

* **Multiprocessing and Threading:** The code heavily utilizes multiprocessing (`Process`, `Manager`, `Event`) and threading (`Thread`) for concurrent operations, including separate threads for Android communication (sending and receiving), STM communication, and the main RPI queue listener.

* **STM Communication:** The script establishes a connection with an STM device using `STMLink`, sending commands and waiting for "DONE" acknowledgements. Error handling is present for connection failures and timeouts.

* **Android Communication:** Although mostly commented out, the framework for Android communication exists, using queues for inter-thread communication and JSON for message formatting.  The `recv_android` function handles incoming commands (`sendArena` for obstacle data and `stm` for robot control commands). The `send_android` function sends updates (image-rec, location, etc.) to the Android device.  A `reconnect_android` function manages automatic reconnection attempts.  A test function (`test_android`) simulates sending various message types.


* **Image Processing and Upload:** The script captures images using `PiCamera` (if on an RPI), converts them to JPEG format, and uploads them to a remote image server (`IMAGE_SERVER`).  It handles potential errors during image capture and upload, logging successes and failures.  The `take_snapshot` function handles image capture and manages the `PiRGBArray`.

* **Queue Management:**  A manager queue (`rpi_action_queue`) is used to handle commands directed at the RPI, which are processed based on their category ("snap" for image capture, "control" for robot control).


* **Error Handling:** The code includes comprehensive error handling throughout, using `try-except` blocks to catch various exceptions (e.g., `OSError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`, `Exception`, `serial.SerialException`).  Logging is performed using a custom `prepare_logger` function.

The script demonstrates a complex system design with robust error handling, leveraging multiple processes and threads for efficient management of different tasks (camera operation, communication with Android/STM, image processing, and data transfer).  The extensive use of queues ensures that these operations run concurrently without interference.


## 3:00:40 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Week8.py` file between 2:10 PM and 2:46 PM on September 18, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is within the `take_snapshot` function.

Initially, the `take_snapshot` function lacked robust error handling and image validation.  The first few revisions added more comprehensive error handling for camera capture failures and image upload issues to the image processing pipeline.  Logging statements were also enhanced to provide more detailed information about the success or failure of various steps.

A significant change occurred around 2:25 PM, where substantial additions were made to the `take_snapshot` function. These additions included:

* **Image validation:** Checks were added to ensure the captured image has the expected dimensions (H,W,3) and data type (np.uint8).  Non-compliant images raise a `RuntimeError`.
* **Image conversion:** The code now explicitly converts the image to a contiguous uint8 array using `np.ascontiguousarray` to ensure compatibility with OpenCV's `imencode` function.
* **JPEG encoding and local file saving:** The raw image is encoded to JPEG format using OpenCV's `imencode` function with adjustable quality. A temporary file is created with `.tmp` extension, ensuring atomicity in file writing and preventing file corruption. The temporary file is then renamed to the final `.jpg` file using `os.replace`. This ensures that even if a crash occurs during the file write process, a partially written, possibly corrupted file won't be left behind.  A UUID is added to prevent filename collisions. The code also handles potential exceptions during the local file write operation.
* **Error Handling in Finally Block:** The `finally` block ensuring the buffer is cleared was enhanced with additional exception handling.


The changes at 2:30 PM and 2:31 PM seem to be minor edits and likely reflect continued refinement of the error handling and logging within the `take_snapshot` function.  The final revision at 2:46 PM made a small modification to the `rpi_queue_listener` function simplifying the call to `take_snapshot`.  The `handle_snap_command` function was removed, and the call to `take_snapshot` is now made directly within `rpi_queue_listener` when a "snap" command is received.
