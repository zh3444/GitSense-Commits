# Activity Summary for 9/24/2025

## 9:33:38 AM
The codebase primarily manages communication and control between a Raspberry Pi (RPI), an Android device, and an STM microcontroller.  The main changes between the two commits are minor.


The `Week8.py` file, updated on September 23rd and 24th, 2025, shows a robust system architecture.  The September 24th update includes a critical addition of a `with self.movement_lock:` block around the line `self.rpi_action_queue.put(PiAction("control", outer["value"]))` within the `recv_android` function.  This locks the queue to prevent concurrent access to the STM control commands, likely addressing a race condition.  No other functional changes were made.

The system uses multiple queues (`android_queue`, `rpi_action_queue`, `stm_queue`, `path_queue`) managed by a `multiprocessing.Manager`.  It handles image capture via `PiCamera` (if on an RPI), image uploading to an `IMAGE_SERVER`, and path planning via an `ALGO_SERVER`. Communication with Android is done via Bluetooth using `AndroidLink`, and with the STM via serial communication using `STMLink`.  The code extensively uses threads and processes for concurrency, demonstrating a multi-threaded and multi-process design.  Error handling and logging are implemented throughout the code. The overall structure of the code remains unchanged between the two commits, focusing primarily on improving thread safety.
