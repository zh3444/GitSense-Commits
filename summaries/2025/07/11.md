# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 2:46:55 PM
The log shows development of a budget tracking application with frontend and backend components.

**Frontend Changes (React):**

* **`BottomNav.jsx` (7/11/2025, 1:47:27 PM):**  A bottom navigation bar component was created using `react-router-dom` for navigation between home, statistics, transactions, and profile pages.  Lucide-React icons are used for visual representation.

* **`Sidebar.jsx` (7/11/2025, 1:47:41 PM):** A sidebar navigation component was added, similar to `BottomNav`, providing alternative navigation using `react-router-dom` and Lucide-React icons.

* **`HomeHeader.jsx` and `HomeBody.jsx` (7/11/2025, 2:38:48 PM and 2:39:11 PM respectively):**  These components were created to display the home page's header (user greeting, monthly spending progress bar) and body (pie chart showing categorized expenses).  `HomeBody` initially included a scrollable transaction list, later commented out.

* **`Home.jsx` (7/11/2025, 2:39:31 PM and 7/11/2025, 2:45:22 PM):** The main home page component was developed, fetching user data, and transaction data, calculating monthly expenses and categorizing expenses using API calls and displaying the data using `HomeHeader` and `HomeBody`.  The code went through several iterations.  Removed unused imports and code related to total expenses calculations and Google authentication.


**Backend Changes (Node.js/Express):**

* **`transactions.js` (7/11/2025, 1:52:58 PM, 7/11/2025, 1:58:59 PM, 7/11/2025, 2:30:16 PM, and 7/11/2025, 2:42:18 PM):**  The backend API routes for transaction management were implemented.  Initially, it had a route to get all transactions and another incomplete route for getting transactions by the current month.  The `transactionsByCurrentMonth` route was completed, returning a monthly total alongside transactions.  This route went through iterations to improve the calculation of monthly expenses.  The implementation to calculate `monthlyTotal` was adjusted from `forEach` to `map` and a condition to only add the amount when it's an expense was added.  An Apple Pay transaction route was added, requiring user authentication.

**API Changes:**

* **`api.js` (7/11/2025, 1:55:14 PM, 7/11/2025, 1:55:22 PM, and 7/11/2025, 2:02:27 PM):** The API calls for fetching transactions were developed. Initially, only `getAllTransactions` existed. `getCurrentMonthTransactions` was added to fetch transactions for the current month.  There were two identical entries in the log for the same file, seemingly a mistake in logging.



**Overall Pattern:**

The development process involved iterative refinement of the backend API routes and frontend components.  The code demonstrates a clear separation of concerns between the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express) layers.  The application uses a token-based authentication system for securing API endpoints. The frontend components utilize Tailwind CSS for styling.
