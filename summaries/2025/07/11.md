# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 2:46:55 PM
The log shows development of a budget tracking application with frontend and backend components.

**Frontend Changes (React):**

* **`BottomNav.jsx` (7/11/2025, 1:47:27 PM):**  A bottom navigation bar component was created using `react-router-dom` for navigation between home, statistics, transactions, and profile pages.  Lucide-React icons are used for visual representation.

* **`Sidebar.jsx` (7/11/2025, 1:47:41 PM):** A sidebar navigation component was added, similar to `BottomNav`, providing alternative navigation using `react-router-dom` and Lucide-React icons.

* **`HomeHeader.jsx` and `HomeBody.jsx` (7/11/2025, 2:38:48 PM and 2:39:11 PM respectively):**  These components were created to display the home page's header (user greeting, monthly spending progress bar) and body (pie chart showing categorized expenses).  `HomeBody` initially included a scrollable transaction list, later commented out.

* **`Home.jsx` (7/11/2025, 2:39:31 PM and 7/11/2025, 2:45:22 PM):** The main home page component was developed, fetching user data, and transaction data, calculating monthly expenses and categorizing expenses using API calls and displaying the data using `HomeHeader` and `HomeBody`.  The code went through several iterations.  Removed unused imports and code related to total expenses calculations and Google authentication.


**Backend Changes (Node.js/Express):**

* **`transactions.js` (7/11/2025, 1:52:58 PM, 7/11/2025, 1:58:59 PM, 7/11/2025, 2:30:16 PM, and 7/11/2025, 2:42:18 PM):**  The backend API routes for transaction management were implemented.  Initially, it had a route to get all transactions and another incomplete route for getting transactions by the current month.  The `transactionsByCurrentMonth` route was completed, returning a monthly total alongside transactions.  This route went through iterations to improve the calculation of monthly expenses.  The implementation to calculate `monthlyTotal` was adjusted from `forEach` to `map` and a condition to only add the amount when it's an expense was added.  An Apple Pay transaction route was added, requiring user authentication.

**API Changes:**

* **`api.js` (7/11/2025, 1:55:14 PM, 7/11/2025, 1:55:22 PM, and 7/11/2025, 2:02:27 PM):** The API calls for fetching transactions were developed. Initially, only `getAllTransactions` existed. `getCurrentMonthTransactions` was added to fetch transactions for the current month.  There were two identical entries in the log for the same file, seemingly a mistake in logging.



**Overall Pattern:**

The development process involved iterative refinement of the backend API routes and frontend components.  The code demonstrates a clear separation of concerns between the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express) layers.  The application uses a token-based authentication system for securing API endpoints. The frontend components utilize Tailwind CSS for styling.


## 4:47:16 PM
The log shows development of a budget tracking application.  Significant changes occurred between 2:47 PM and 4:45 PM on July 11, 2025.

**`Home.jsx`**: This file underwent several revisions, primarily focused on refining the handling of user authentication and transaction data. Initially, the component fetched and displayed monthly transactions, grouping expenses by category.  Later updates removed the `computeMonthlyExpenses` function (likely replaced by backend filtering) and simplified the component.  The consistent element throughout the `Home.jsx` updates is the use of useEffect hooks for managing authentication, fetching transactions and updating the UI state.  The Gmail token authentication logic remains unchanged.


**`App.jsx`**: This file was updated twice. The first update added a route for the `/transactions` page at approximately 2:49 PM. The second update didn't significantly alter the file's structure, only incorporating the newly added Transactions page into the routing configuration.


**`Transactions.jsx`**: This component evolved significantly over time. It started as a simple placeholder. Subsequent updates introduced:
    * State management for transactions, loading status, and pagination.
    * An `fetchTransactions` function for retrieving data using `getAllTransactions` from the API with pagination and filtering capabilities (search, category, start/end dates, and type).
    * Error handling within the `fetchTransactions` function.
    * Implementation of a pagination component using the `Pagination`,  `PaginationContent`, `PaginationItem`, `PaginationLink`, `PaginationNext`, and `PaginationPrevious` components from `@/components/ui/pagination`.
    * Display of transaction data using `Card` and `CardContent` components.
    * Grouping transactions by date using `groupTransactionsByDate` and displaying them accordingly.  The initial implementation had a bug (missing closing curly brace in `reduce` function) that was later fixed. The final version sorts the grouped transactions by date in descending order.


**`api/transaction/api.js`**: This file contains functions for interacting with the transaction API. It includes functions to retrieve all transactions (with query parameters) and to get transactions for the current month.


**`backend/routes/transactions.js`**: This file manages backend routes for transactions. Updates introduced sophisticated query handling to support filtering transactions by search term, category, start/end dates, and transaction type. It uses the Mongoose library for database interactions. Pagination was implemented using `skip` and `limit` for efficient data retrieval.


The overall pattern shows a phased development process, starting with basic functionality and iteratively adding features such as pagination, filtering, and improved UI presentation, illustrating a gradual refinement of both frontend and backend components for enhanced user experience and data management.
