# Activity Summary for 7/30/2025

## 4:37:47 PM
The log shows two revisions of `analyzeDocument.js` on July 30, 2025.  Both revisions utilize Axios to interact with an Azure Form Recognizer API (version 2023-7-31), using an API key stored in a `.env` file (not shown).  The `analyzeDocument` function uploads a file specified by `filePath` to Azure for analysis using a specified model (defaulting to 'prebuilt-bankStatement').

The key difference between the two revisions (3:56:22 PM and 3:56:50 PM) is the addition of a `listModels` function and its subsequent use within `analyzeDocument`. The later revision retrieves available Azure models using `listModels` before making the analysis request, adding logging to display these available models.  Both revisions include extensive logging for debugging purposes.  The code consistently handles errors by catching exceptions and providing informative error messages.
