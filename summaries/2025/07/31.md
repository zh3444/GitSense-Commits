# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 3:27:39 PM
The log shows development of an email processing system for a budget tracker application.  The primary focus is on parsing bank statements from email attachments using Google Cloud Document AI.

Between 12:31 PM and 12:32 PM, the `googleDocAI.js` file was updated to include `dotenv` for environment variable loading, allowing the script to access the `GOOGLE_DOCAI_PROCESSOR_ID` from the `.env` file.  A subsequent change at 12:35 PM modified `extractTransactionsFromDocument` to accept and use the `userId` parameter, improving transaction record-keeping.

The `.gitignore` file was updated at 12:33 PM, adding `google-service-account.json` to the list of ignored files, indicating a shift towards a more secure way of managing credentials.

The `.env` file was modified several times. Notably, at 12:33 PM, `GOOGLE_DOCAI_PROCESSOR_ID` was added, specifying the Document AI processor ID.  Later, at 12:46 PM, `GOOGLE_DOCAI_ENDPOINT` was added, likely providing another way to configure the DocAI service.

Finally, `googleDocAI.js` underwent two significant changes related to authentication. At 1:31 PM a `console.log` statement was added for debugging purposes. Then, a more substantial change at 2:59 PM altered the `DocumentProcessorServiceClient` initialization, replacing the path to a service account key file with `/secrets/docai-service-account`, suggesting a move to a more secure secret management approach.  This indicates a transition to storing credentials outside the main codebase (potentially using a secrets manager).  The overall development pattern involved iterative refinement of the Google Cloud Document AI integration, emphasizing improved security and robustness.
