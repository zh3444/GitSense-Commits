# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 3:27:39 PM
The log shows development of an email processing system for a budget tracker application.  The primary focus is on parsing bank statements from email attachments using Google Cloud Document AI.

Between 12:31 PM and 12:32 PM, the `googleDocAI.js` file was updated to include `dotenv` for environment variable loading, allowing the script to access the `GOOGLE_DOCAI_PROCESSOR_ID` from the `.env` file.  A subsequent change at 12:35 PM modified `extractTransactionsFromDocument` to accept and use the `userId` parameter, improving transaction record-keeping.

The `.gitignore` file was updated at 12:33 PM, adding `google-service-account.json` to the list of ignored files, indicating a shift towards a more secure way of managing credentials.

The `.env` file was modified several times. Notably, at 12:33 PM, `GOOGLE_DOCAI_PROCESSOR_ID` was added, specifying the Document AI processor ID.  Later, at 12:46 PM, `GOOGLE_DOCAI_ENDPOINT` was added, likely providing another way to configure the DocAI service.

Finally, `googleDocAI.js` underwent two significant changes related to authentication. At 1:31 PM a `console.log` statement was added for debugging purposes. Then, a more substantial change at 2:59 PM altered the `DocumentProcessorServiceClient` initialization, replacing the path to a service account key file with `/secrets/docai-service-account`, suggesting a move to a more secure secret management approach.  This indicates a transition to storing credentials outside the main codebase (potentially using a secrets manager).  The overall development pattern involved iterative refinement of the Google Cloud Document AI integration, emphasizing improved security and robustness.


## 4:28:23 PM
The `index.js` file within the `email-worker` directory underwent two revisions on July 31st, 2025.  The first revision (4:00:09 PM) included a basic Express.js server setup listening on port 8080.  The `/run` endpoint was implemented but the core functionality of connecting to MongoDB and processing emails (`processEmails()`) was commented out.  The second revision (4:10:41 PM) activated the MongoDB connection and `processEmails()` function.  The changes between the two versions show a clear progression from a basic setup to a fully functional email processing worker. The key difference lies in uncommenting the code responsible for connecting to a MongoDB database and processing emails via the `processEmails()` function, making it fully operational.


## 9:01:45 PM
The primary change on July 31st, 2025, at 8:27:16 PM involved the `googleDocAI.js` file within the `budgetTracker` application. This file contains a function `parseBankStatement` that uses the Google Cloud Document AI API to process bank statements.  The function takes a base64 encoded bank statement, filename, and userId as input.  It temporarily saves the base64 data to `/tmp`, processes it using the `processDocument` method from the `@google-cloud/documentai` library, and extracts transaction details.  The extraction logic (within `extractTransactionsFromDocument`) assumes a table format in the bank statement with at least three columns (date, description, amount). Extracted transactions are then returned, each marked with a `flagged` property set to `false`. Error handling is included via a `try...catch` block.  The code utilizes environment variables (loaded via `dotenv`) for the Google DocAI processor ID and service account key file path.  Note that the actual key file path is not included in this summary, due to security concerns.


## 11:01:45 PM
The log shows updates to a Google DocAI integration within a budget tracking application.  The `googleDocAI.js` file underwent several revisions between 10:12 PM and 11:00 PM on July 31, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on adding debugging `console.log` statements to aid in identifying issues with the document parsing process.  Specifically,  `console.log` statements were added to display the `client` object (10:12 PM), the `pages` array (10:28 PM), and the `cells` array (10:28 PM) within the `extractTransactionsFromDocument` function.  A substantial addition at 11:00 PM included logging the entire `document` object from Google DocAI's output using `JSON.stringify` for more comprehensive debugging information.

Meanwhile, the `.env` file was updated several times between 10:11 PM and 10:15 PM on July 31, 2025.  The most significant change was a correction to the `GOOGLE_DOCAI_PROCESSOR_ID` environment variable.  Initially, it seems to have been incorrectly formatted,  but was subsequently updated to a properly structured project identifier.  These updates to the `.env` file directly impact the `googleDocAI.js` file because that file reads configuration values from the `.env` file using `dotenv`.
