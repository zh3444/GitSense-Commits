# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 8:59:23 PM
The log shows a series of code changes across frontend and backend components of a budget tracking application, primarily focused on integrating with the Finverse API for transaction data retrieval.

**Backend (finverse.js):**

*  The `finverse.js` file underwent multiple revisions between 8:10 PM and 8:56 PM.  The core functionality remained consistent:  linking a user's account to Finverse, exchanging a public token for an access token, fetching transactions, and handling webhooks.
*  Initial versions lacked authentication for the `/link` route. This was addressed by incorporating `authenticateToken` middleware around 8:40 PM.
*  The Finverse API endpoint used for creating link tokens changed several times (from `https://api.finverse.com` to `https://api.sandbox.finverse.com` and finally to `https://api.prod.finverse.net`).  This suggests a shift from a sandbox environment to a production environment.  The `token/exchange` endpoint consistently used `https://api.finverse.com`.
*  Error handling was improved by adding more specific logging around 8:48 PM.


**Frontend (Profile.jsx):**

*  The `Profile.jsx` component was modified multiple times between 8:11 PM and 8:41 PM.  The main change was in how Finverse connection is initiated. Initially,  it used `FinverseConnect` library directly; later (around 8:13 PM),  it was simplified to a redirect using the link URL obtained from the backend.
*  Authentication was added to the fetch request around 8:41 PM, sending the user's token in the `Authorization` header.


**Frontend (FinverseCallback.jsx):**

*   This component, modified between 8:16 PM and 8:19 PM, handles the callback from Finverse after the user connects their account.  The key change was adding error handling and redirection to the `/home` page after successfully exchanging the public token.


**Frontend (Home.jsx):**

*   The `Home.jsx` component was updated between 8:23 PM and 8:25 PM. A commented-out section indicates a removed test call to fetch Finverse transactions. The component primarily focuses on fetching and displaying monthly transactions and categorizing expenses.  It also includes logic for handling Gmail authentication.


**Frontend (App.jsx):**

*  The `App.jsx` component, updated at 8:27 PM,  sets up the routing for the application, including routes for login, registration, home, transactions, profile, and the Finverse callback.


In summary, the code changes reflect the iterative development and deployment of Finverse integration into the budget tracking application. The most significant changes involve refining the Finverse API interaction, adding authentication, and improving error handling across both the frontend and backend. The final change to `finverse.js` likely represents the move to a production Finverse environment.
