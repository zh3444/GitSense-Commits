# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 4:18:21 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `TransactionModal.jsx` component between 11:45 AM and 3:24 PM on July 15, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on transforming the component from a display-only modal to one that allows for editing transactions.

Initially (11:45 AM), the modal only displayed transaction details.  Subsequent changes introduced form handling using `react-hook-form` and `zod` for validation (11:58 AM). The category options were restricted to a predefined list ("Food", "Transport", "Shopping", "Uncategorized") around 12:01 PM.  At 12:04 PM, default values from the `transaction` prop were added to the form.  An `onSubmit` handler was added at 12:05 PM, logging the form data to the console.

Between 12:11 PM and 12:20 PM, the UI was refactored, incorporating custom form components from `@/components/ui/form` and  `./ui/input`.  The edit functionality was implemented at 12:15 PM, initially showing only a placeholder (`<div>Edit</div>`). The conditional rendering for edit mode was completed by 12:20 PM along with improvements to the handling of default values to prevent errors if the `transaction` prop is null.  A `useEffect` hook was added at 12:28 PM to log the default values of the form and further improved at 12:30 PM, ensuring that the form is properly reset when the transaction prop updates. By 12:34 PM, the edit mode included form fields for "Merchant" and "Amount".

The addition of a date picker component (`./ui/calendar`) within a `Popover` component  (`./ui/popover`), using `date-fns` for date formatting, started at 1:05 PM and was finished by 1:39 PM. The changes included using `Controller` from `react-hook-form` for better form state management of the `date`, `category` and `type` fields starting from 12:47 PM.  The `Select` component was also changed to allow easier selection.  Around 2:30 PM, a  `Type` select was added to the edit form.

The final version (3:24 PM) features a fully functional edit mode with input fields for merchant, amount, category, date (using a date picker), and transaction type.  The 'Edit' button text was changed to 'Back', and a 'Save' button was added for submitting changes.  The amount input is preprocessed to handle string values and convert them to numbers. The styling of the date picker button was refined at 2:56PM.  Finally, the Save button's background color was modified to a green hue at 3:23 PM.

The `api.js` file shows functions for getting all transactions, current month transactions, and deleting transactions. An `editTransaction` function is added at 4:08 PM. The backend routes (`transactions.js`) were updated to include a PUT endpoint for editing transactions at 3:29 PM, corresponding with the addition of the `editTransaction` function in the frontend.
