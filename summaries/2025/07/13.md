# Activity Summary for 7/13/2025

## 9:58:51 PM
The log shows iterative development of a `FilterCheckbox` component and its integration into a `Transactions` page within a React-based budget tracking application.

The `FilterCheckbox.jsx` component underwent significant changes between 7/13/2025, 9:10 PM and 9:52 PM.  Initially, it displayed a single checkbox for filtering by 'year'. This was subsequently modified to filter by 'expense', and the functionality evolved considerably to incorporate state management (using `useState` hook) and handling checkbox changes more robustly.  The final version includes two checkboxes, one for 'expense' and another for 'income', with mutually exclusive selection. The `handleCheck` function updates the filter state using a `setFilters` prop, correctly setting the `type` filter to either 'expense', 'income', or `null`.  There were several intermediate steps involving experimentation with event handling (`onClick`, `onCheckedChange`), parameter passing to `handleCheck`, and refinement of the state update logic in `setFilters`.

The `Transactions.jsx` component, updated at 7/13/2025, 9:43:29 PM, incorporates the refined `FilterCheckbox` component and displays transactions based on filters, including text search and the newly added 'type' filter ('expense' or 'income').  The Transactions page also shows pagination functionality.  The primary change here is integrating the `filters.type` parameter into the API call to retrieve transactions.

In summary, the key development pattern involves incremental refinement of the `FilterCheckbox` component's functionality, focusing on improving the event handling and state management of the checkboxes to filter transactions appropriately by type (expense/income) within the application's `Transactions` page.  The final version of `FilterCheckbox` provides an interactive filter that correctly updates the application state.
