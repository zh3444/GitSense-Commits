# Activity Summary for 7/14/2025

## 12:07:42 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `FilterCheckbox.jsx` between 11:09 AM and 12:07 PM on July 14, 2025.  The component is a filter for transactions, allowing filtering by expense/income type, date range, and category.

Initially, the component used a simple Checkbox for expense and income filtering and a DatePicker for date filtering.

Between 11:14 AM and 11:18 AM, an Accordion component was introduced, initially wrapping the income checkbox, and subsequently improved to include the income checkbox and content within an AccordionItem and AccordionTrigger.  Minor styling adjustments also occurred.


Around 11:23 AM, the Accordion component was replaced with a Collapsible component from the `./ui/collapsible` module, improving the category filter's presentation. The category filter checkboxes were added within a collapsible section, which opens and closes based on `isCategoryChecked` state.  The styling and layout were refined throughout this period, using classes like `flex`, `gap-2`, and `flex-col`.

From 11:31 AM to 11:39 AM, further styling changes to the category section were made by adding a `div` to wrap the `p` tag containing "test" content and finally adjusting the layout of the category checkboxes to be displayed in a column within the Collapsible component.

Between 11:39 AM and 11:44 AM, the `categoryList` array was transformed from a simple string array into an array of objects, each containing `category` (string) and `checked` (boolean) properties. This allows for individual category checkboxes, dynamically populated based on the categoryList state.  The `categoryList` state was also added to manage its updates independently. The `onCheckedChange` handler in the category checkbox was updated to properly update the checked state of the individual categories.

Finally, between 11:58 AM and 12:07 PM, the `onCheckedChange` function for the category checkboxes was corrected to update the categoryList state accurately. It now maps through the `categoryList` array, updating the `checked` property of the corresponding category object. The `handleCheck` function was also updated to properly set the filter when handling the category checkboxes.  Minor layout tweaks using `gap-4` and `px-2` further refined the appearance.  The changes consistently leverage React's functional component features and state management for interactive filtering.

The `transactions.js` file, updated at 12:01 PM, shows backend routes for handling transaction data, including fetching transactions with various filtering options (search, category, date, type),  retrieving transactions for the current month, and adding transactions via Apple Pay.  The `Transactions.jsx` file (updated at 12:01 PM and 12:01 PM), which displays transactions on the frontend, shows integration with the `FilterCheckbox` component and pagination features for better UX. The changes in `Transactions.jsx` involved a small correction to the filters state's `category` property type which is changed from array to `null`.
