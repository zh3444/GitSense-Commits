# Activity Summary for 7/29/2025

## 11:48:50 AM
The log shows development on a Node.js application for processing bank statement emails.  The primary focus is on the `normalizeBankStatement` function within `normalize.js`.

Between 10:57 AM and 11:06 AM, `normalize.js` underwent significant changes.  Initially, the function was incomplete.  Subsequent commits added functionality to extract transaction details (merchant, amount, date, and category) from a bank statement document object.  Error handling was improved by providing default values for missing fields.  Crucially, a `flagged` property was added to indicate low confidence in extracted data (confidence below 0.7). The function was finalized with the addition of a `return` statement.

At 11:24 AM,  `saveBase64ToFile.js` was created, providing a utility to save base64 encoded files to the local filesystem.

From 11:34 AM to 11:38 AM, `parseAttachment.js` was developed to handle email attachments.  It uses `saveBase64ToFile` to store the attachment, then calls a document analysis service (`analyzeDocument` and `pollAnalysisResult`), and finally, uses `normalizeBankStatement` to parse the results if the model is 'prebuilt-bankStatement'.

Finally, at 11:39 AM, `processEmails.js` was added, which fetches emails from Gmail using the Google APIs, extracts transaction data using functions defined elsewhere (`extractTransactionFromText`, `getEmailBody`, etc.), and persists it to a database (`Transaction` model).  This file uses environment variables (loaded via `dotenv`), suggesting a configuration file is used to store sensitive credentials. The code also includes logic to handle invalid refresh tokens and update the `lastEmailCheck` timestamp for each user.  Error handling is implemented throughout the function.  The email extraction logic appears to be custom-built to handle specific text patterns within the email body.


## 12:48:53 PM
The codebase focuses on building an email-based budget tracker.  Several files were modified between 12:07 PM and 12:48 PM on July 29, 2025.

The `processEmails.js` file underwent multiple revisions. The primary change was the addition of attachment processing. Initially (12:07 PM), the script only processed email bodies. Subsequent updates (12:09 PM and 12:10 PM) incorporated logic to handle attachments (PDFs and images), using the `parseAttachment` service and a 'prebuilt-bankStatement' model for analysis.  Error handling was improved in the final version (12:10 PM), specifically for attachment parsing failures.  A `foundValidTransaction` flag was added to prevent unnecessary updates to the `lastEmailCheck` time.

The `Transaction.js` model (both in `email-worker` and `backend`) was updated at 12:10 PM and 12:11 PM respectively to include a `flagged` field (boolean) in the schema, likely indicating transactions requiring further review.  The backend version also added a text index on `merchant` and `category` fields for improved search capabilities.

The `analyzeDocument.js` file (12:24 PM) handles uploading documents to Azure Form Recognizer for analysis using the provided API key and endpoint.

The `parseAttachment.js` file (updated at 12:34 PM and 12:40 PM â€“ only minor changes like adding `.js` extensions) coordinates the attachment processing pipeline: saving the base64 encoded attachment, sending it to Azure for analysis using `analyzeDocument`, polling for results via `pollAnalysisResult`, and finally normalizing the results using `normalizeBankStatement`.

The `normalize.js` file (12:42 PM) defines the function to convert raw Azure Form Recognizer output (specifically for bank statements) into a structured transaction format, including flagging transactions with low confidence scores.

Finally, the `auth.js` file (12:48 PM) is related to user authentication and authorization, providing endpoints for login, registration, and checking the validity of Gmail tokens.  It uses JWT for authentication and bcrypt for password hashing.  A new endpoint `/check-gmail-token` was added to handle re-authentication scenarios.

The overall pattern is a microservice architecture with different modules responsible for specific tasks: email fetching and processing, data modeling, document analysis, and authentication. The code relies heavily on asynchronous operations and external services like Google's Gmail API and Azure Form Recognizer.
