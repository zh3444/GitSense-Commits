# Activity Summary for 7/29/2025

## 11:48:50 AM
The log shows development on a Node.js application for processing bank statement emails.  The primary focus is on the `normalizeBankStatement` function within `normalize.js`.

Between 10:57 AM and 11:06 AM, `normalize.js` underwent significant changes.  Initially, the function was incomplete.  Subsequent commits added functionality to extract transaction details (merchant, amount, date, and category) from a bank statement document object.  Error handling was improved by providing default values for missing fields.  Crucially, a `flagged` property was added to indicate low confidence in extracted data (confidence below 0.7). The function was finalized with the addition of a `return` statement.

At 11:24 AM,  `saveBase64ToFile.js` was created, providing a utility to save base64 encoded files to the local filesystem.

From 11:34 AM to 11:38 AM, `parseAttachment.js` was developed to handle email attachments.  It uses `saveBase64ToFile` to store the attachment, then calls a document analysis service (`analyzeDocument` and `pollAnalysisResult`), and finally, uses `normalizeBankStatement` to parse the results if the model is 'prebuilt-bankStatement'.

Finally, at 11:39 AM, `processEmails.js` was added, which fetches emails from Gmail using the Google APIs, extracts transaction data using functions defined elsewhere (`extractTransactionFromText`, `getEmailBody`, etc.), and persists it to a database (`Transaction` model).  This file uses environment variables (loaded via `dotenv`), suggesting a configuration file is used to store sensitive credentials. The code also includes logic to handle invalid refresh tokens and update the `lastEmailCheck` timestamp for each user.  Error handling is implemented throughout the function.  The email extraction logic appears to be custom-built to handle specific text patterns within the email body.
