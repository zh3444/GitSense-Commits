# Activity Summary for 7/29/2025

## 11:48:50 AM
The log shows development on a Node.js application for processing bank statement emails.  The primary focus is on the `normalizeBankStatement` function within `normalize.js`.

Between 10:57 AM and 11:06 AM, `normalize.js` underwent significant changes.  Initially, the function was incomplete.  Subsequent commits added functionality to extract transaction details (merchant, amount, date, and category) from a bank statement document object.  Error handling was improved by providing default values for missing fields.  Crucially, a `flagged` property was added to indicate low confidence in extracted data (confidence below 0.7). The function was finalized with the addition of a `return` statement.

At 11:24 AM,  `saveBase64ToFile.js` was created, providing a utility to save base64 encoded files to the local filesystem.

From 11:34 AM to 11:38 AM, `parseAttachment.js` was developed to handle email attachments.  It uses `saveBase64ToFile` to store the attachment, then calls a document analysis service (`analyzeDocument` and `pollAnalysisResult`), and finally, uses `normalizeBankStatement` to parse the results if the model is 'prebuilt-bankStatement'.

Finally, at 11:39 AM, `processEmails.js` was added, which fetches emails from Gmail using the Google APIs, extracts transaction data using functions defined elsewhere (`extractTransactionFromText`, `getEmailBody`, etc.), and persists it to a database (`Transaction` model).  This file uses environment variables (loaded via `dotenv`), suggesting a configuration file is used to store sensitive credentials. The code also includes logic to handle invalid refresh tokens and update the `lastEmailCheck` timestamp for each user.  Error handling is implemented throughout the function.  The email extraction logic appears to be custom-built to handle specific text patterns within the email body.


## 12:48:53 PM
The codebase focuses on building an email-based budget tracker.  Several files were modified between 12:07 PM and 12:48 PM on July 29, 2025.

The `processEmails.js` file underwent multiple revisions. The primary change was the addition of attachment processing. Initially (12:07 PM), the script only processed email bodies. Subsequent updates (12:09 PM and 12:10 PM) incorporated logic to handle attachments (PDFs and images), using the `parseAttachment` service and a 'prebuilt-bankStatement' model for analysis.  Error handling was improved in the final version (12:10 PM), specifically for attachment parsing failures.  A `foundValidTransaction` flag was added to prevent unnecessary updates to the `lastEmailCheck` time.

The `Transaction.js` model (both in `email-worker` and `backend`) was updated at 12:10 PM and 12:11 PM respectively to include a `flagged` field (boolean) in the schema, likely indicating transactions requiring further review.  The backend version also added a text index on `merchant` and `category` fields for improved search capabilities.

The `analyzeDocument.js` file (12:24 PM) handles uploading documents to Azure Form Recognizer for analysis using the provided API key and endpoint.

The `parseAttachment.js` file (updated at 12:34 PM and 12:40 PM â€“ only minor changes like adding `.js` extensions) coordinates the attachment processing pipeline: saving the base64 encoded attachment, sending it to Azure for analysis using `analyzeDocument`, polling for results via `pollAnalysisResult`, and finally normalizing the results using `normalizeBankStatement`.

The `normalize.js` file (12:42 PM) defines the function to convert raw Azure Form Recognizer output (specifically for bank statements) into a structured transaction format, including flagging transactions with low confidence scores.

Finally, the `auth.js` file (12:48 PM) is related to user authentication and authorization, providing endpoints for login, registration, and checking the validity of Gmail tokens.  It uses JWT for authentication and bcrypt for password hashing.  A new endpoint `/check-gmail-token` was added to handle re-authentication scenarios.

The overall pattern is a microservice architecture with different modules responsible for specific tasks: email fetching and processing, data modeling, document analysis, and authentication. The code relies heavily on asynchronous operations and external services like Google's Gmail API and Azure Form Recognizer.


## 1:48:47 PM
The provided log only contains a `.env` file, which is excluded from summarization due to its sensitive nature (containing API keys, secrets, and URLs).  Therefore, no summary of code changes can be provided.


## 2:49:04 PM
The codebase reflects development on a budget tracking application with Gmail integration and Azure form recognition capabilities.  Significant changes occurred around 2:30 PM on July 29th, 2025.


`Home.jsx` (src\pages\home\Home.jsx): This React component displays user transactions, categorized expenses, and monthly totals.  A key update at 2:35:56 PM involved fixing a bug in the Gmail authentication flow by removing commented-out code and adding a check for `status.needsReauth` before redirecting to Google authentication. The component fetches transaction data and organizes expenses by category.

`gmail.js` (backend\routes\gmail.js): This file handles the Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.  Updated at 2:26:49 PM,  it implements robust nonce verification to prevent CSRF attacks, ensuring that the state parameter received from the Google callback matches the one stored in the session.  Upon successful authentication, tokens and user profile information are saved in the session.

`index.js` (backend\index.js): This backend entry point sets up Express.js, connects to MongoDB, and configures various middleware, including session management with `connect-mongo`,  CORS handling, and passport for authentication. Updated at 2:32:55 PM, it configures CORS to allow requests from specific origins.


`email-worker\services\analyzeDocument.js`: This file uses the Azure Form Recognizer API to process documents. Updated at 2:42:51 PM, it takes a file path, sends it to Azure for analysis, and returns the operation location.  The code uses environment variables for Azure credentials and endpoint.


A recurring theme is the use of nonces for security in the authentication flow, demonstrated in both the frontend and backend authentication code. The project uses a combination of technologies: React for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for database, and Azure for document processing.  The `Home.jsx` component relies heavily on API calls (`checkGmailTokenStatus`, `getCurrentMonthTransactions`) suggesting a microservice architecture.


## 3:50:06 PM
The codebase is an email processing system for a budget tracker application.  Several files were updated on July 29, 2025.

`parseAttachment.js` (3:05:01 PM): This service handles parsing attachments from emails. It takes a base64 encoded string, filename, userId, and optionally a model (defaulting to 'prebuilt-bankStatement').  It saves the attachment to a file using `saveBase64ToFile`, sends it to Azure for analysis using `analyzeDocument`, polls for results using `pollAnalysisResult`, normalizes the results if it's a bank statement using `normalizeBankStatement`, and returns the parsed data.

`analyzeDocument.js` (3:07:13 PM): This service uploads a file to Azure Form Recognizer for analysis. It uses an Azure endpoint and API key (read from a `.env` file - content omitted for security reasons).  The function handles potential errors during the upload process.

`processEmails.js` (3:15:08 PM): This is the main function that processes emails. It fetches users with valid Gmail refresh tokens, iterates through their emails (filtering for emails with the subject 'transaction' and sent since the last check), and extracts transaction details. It handles both text-based transactions using `extractTransactionFromText` and attachments (PDF/images) by using `parseAttachment`. Transactions are saved to the database using the `Transaction` model.  The code includes helper functions for OAuth2 token validation (`testTokenValidity`) and email body extraction (`getEmailBody`). The `extractTransactionFromText` function attempts to extract transaction amount, date, merchant, and category from email content using regular expressions. The `getEmailBody` function handles different email structures and decodes the body from base64.


`saveBase64ToFile.js` (3:21:41 PM and 3:22:29 PM): This utility function saves a base64 encoded string to a file. The function was updated twice within a short time frame (3:21:41 PM and 3:22:29 PM), adding a `console.log` statement to print the file path in the second update.

The overall pattern shows a system designed to automatically process bank statements and other transaction-related emails, extract relevant financial data, and store it in a database.  The use of Azure Form Recognizer suggests an intent to automate the extraction process even from complex documents. The multiple updates to `saveBase64ToFile.js` suggest iterative debugging or enhancement of the file saving process.


## 8:55:54 PM
The log shows multiple entries for the `.env` file, all with identical content, at timestamps 7/29/2025, 7:51:37 PM, 7:51:52 PM, and 7:52:22 PM.  The file contains environment variables for a project, including connection strings for MongoDB and Azure, API URLs, client IDs (Google and Finverse), secret keys (JWT and session), and other configuration settings.  The frequent identical updates to the `.env` file suggest potential logging issues or repeated attempts to save the configuration file.  No actual changes to the environment variables are observed in the provided log.
