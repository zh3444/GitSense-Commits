# Activity Summary for 7/12/2025

## 4:11:56 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `Transactions.jsx` component and related files within a React application, likely a budget tracker.  The backend (`transactions.js`) handles API requests for transactions.

**`c:\Users\zhiha\budgetTracker\budgetTrack\backend\routes\transactions.js` (7/12/2025, 2:19:11 PM):** This file defines backend routes for handling transaction data.  It includes endpoints for retrieving transactions (with pagination and filtering options like search, category, date range, and type), retrieving transactions for the current month, and handling Apple Pay transactions using email and password authentication with bcrypt for security.

**`c:\Users\zhiha\budgetTracker\budgetTrack\src\pages\transactions\Transactions.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This React component displays transaction data fetched from the backend. The component underwent numerous revisions between 2:37:30 PM and 4:11:28 PM.  Key changes include:

* **Initial Version (2:37:30 PM):**  Basic structure with fetching, grouping transactions by date, and pagination.  The date formatting was incomplete.
* **Date Formatting (2:43:05 PM - 2:44:53 PM):**  Added a `formatDate` function to improve date display in 'en-GB' format.  The UI layout was refined through several commits, adjusting the height and display of the transaction list to improve responsiveness.
* **Pagination Limit Adjustments (2:47:30 PM - 2:51:19 PM):** Multiple commits adjusted the `pagination.limit` value, experimenting with different numbers of transactions shown per page (3, 7, 8, 6).
* **UI Refinements (2:52:50 PM - 2:56:24 PM):** Changes to the `Card` component, updating the padding of `CardContent` and styling the page numbers in the pagination.  The main title "Transactions" was made more prominent.
* **Pagination Improvements (3:15:42 PM - 3:26:48 PM):** Replaced standard buttons with custom `PaginationPrevious` and `PaginationNext` components from `@/components/ui/pagination.jsx`.  Added disabled state handling to pagination buttons.
* **Responsive Design (3:46:19 PM - 4:11:28 PM):**  Introduced `useMediaQuery` hook to adjust the pagination display based on screen size (mobile vs. desktop). For mobile, a simple "Page X of Y" display is used; for desktops, a full pagination with page numbers is shown.  The `getPageRange` function was added to create a more concise pagination range, and the height of the transaction display area was adjusted.  The pagination was also styled to be right-aligned. A loading state was added to improve the user experience while fetching data.


**`c:\Users\zhiha\budgetTracker\budgetTrack\src\components\ui\card.jsx` (2:52:50 PM, 2:53:08 PM):** This component's `CardContent` padding was adjusted from `px-6` to `px-4`.


**`c:\Users\zhiha\budgetTracker\budgetTrack\src\components\ui\pagination.jsx` (3:19:26 PM - 3:26:48 PM):** This file introduces custom pagination components (`PaginationPrevious`, `PaginationNext`, `PaginationEllipsis`) using the Lucide-react icon library and improved the `PaginationLink` component to handle `disabled` states properly, enhancing accessibility.

**`c:\Users\zhiha\budgetTracker\budgetTrack\src\utils\useMediaQuery.jsx` (3:45:48 PM - 3:56:16 PM):** This custom hook was added to detect media queries (screen sizes).  The initial implementation was corrected to properly use `addEventListener` with the 'change' event.

The overall development pattern shows an iterative approach, focusing on UI improvements, responsive design, and progressively enhancing the user experience and component reusability.  The frequent updates to `Transactions.jsx` suggest focused work on the presentation of transaction data.
