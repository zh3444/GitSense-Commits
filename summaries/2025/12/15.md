# Activity Summary for 12/15/2025

## 4:00:58 PM
The file `/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/FYP/fraud_detection/data/processed/sequence_feature_cols.json` was updated on 12/15/2025 at 3:31:03 PM. This update defined a list of 10 feature columns, likely intended for sequence-based modeling in a fraud detection context. The features comprise numerical transaction details such as `amount`, `oldbalanceOrig`, `newbalanceOrig`, `oldbalanceDest`, and `newbalanceDest`, alongside one-hot encoded transaction types including `type_CASH_IN`, `type_CASH_OUT`, `type_TRANSFER`, `type_DEBIT`, and `type_PAYMENT`. The content consistently lists feature names, with a clear pattern of financial balances and transaction types.

The file `/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/FYP/fraud_detection/data/processed/sequence_feature_cols.json` was updated on 12/15/2025, 3:31:03 PM. The change involved defining a JSON array containing a list of feature column names. These columns appear to be numerical transaction details and one-hot encoded transaction types, specifically `amount`, `oldbalanceOrig`, `newbalanceOrig`, `oldbalanceDest`, `newbalanceDest`, and various `type_` related fields (`CASH_IN`, `CASH_OUT`, `TRANSFER`, `DEBIT`, `PAYMENT`). This file likely specifies the features used in a sequence-based fraud detection model.
