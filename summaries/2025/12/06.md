# Activity Summary for 12/6/2025

## 10:56:35 PM
The log details two key updates related to sequence generation and metadata within a fraud detection project.

The file `/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/FYP/fraud_detection/src/preprocessing/sequence_builder.py` was updated on `12/6/2025, 10:10:57 PM`. This update introduces a Python class named `SequenceBuilder`. This class is designed to build fixed-length sequences from input data using the `numpy` library. It initializes with a `sequence_length`, defaulting to 10, and its `build` method iterates through the provided data to create overlapping sequences of that specified length.

Following shortly after, on `12/6/2025, 10:54:59 PM`, the file `/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/FYP/fraud_detection/data/sequences/sequence_metadata.json` was updated. This JSON file provides crucial metadata about a generated sequence dataset. It explicitly states a `sequence_length` of 10, aligning with the default in `SequenceBuilder`. It also records a substantial `num_sequences` of 6,359,991, `num_features` as 15, and lists 11 specific `feature_columns` used, including various transaction attributes like "step", "amount", "oldbalanceOrig", "newbalanceOrig", "oldbalanceDest", "newbalanceDest", and one-hot encoded transaction types ("type_CASH_IN", "type_CASH_OUT", etc.).

A significant pattern observed is the consistent use of `sequence_length: 10`, appearing both as the default in the `SequenceBuilder` class and explicitly in the `sequence_metadata.json` file. This indicates a standardized parameter for sequence generation within the project. The timestamps suggest that the metadata for sequences was likely generated or updated shortly after the sequence building logic was defined or used, highlighting a close relationship between the code that creates sequences and the documentation of their characteristics. The feature columns listed hint at the specific data points being analyzed for fraud detection.
