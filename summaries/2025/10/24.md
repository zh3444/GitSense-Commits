The `server_receive_image.py` file, last modified on October 24, 2025, at 2:12:21 PM, implements a Flask-based image recognition server.

Key functionalities include:

*   **Server Initialization:** It sets up a Flask application that loads a machine learning model (`model.load_model()`) at startup and creates `uploads` and `results` directories to manage incoming and processed images.
*   **`/status` Endpoint:** A GET endpoint `/status` provides a simple health check, confirming the server is running.
*   **`/upload` Endpoint:** This POST endpoint is designed to receive images from a client.
    *   It decodes the incoming image bytes using OpenCV (`cv2.imdecode`).
    *   It then utilizes the loaded model (`predict_image_labels`) to predict labels and bounding boxes within the image, with configurable `imgsz` and `conf` parameters.
    *   If detections are made, it annotates the image with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores using `my_utils.draw_bounding_box`.
    *   The processed (or original, if no detection) image is saved to the `results` folder with a timestamped filename.
    *   Crucially, this endpoint logs detailed performance timings for image decoding, prediction, and saving operations, providing insights into processing bottlenecks.
    *   It returns a JSON response indicating the processing status, whether the image was annotated, and the detected label.
*   **`/stitch_images` Endpoint:** A GET endpoint `/stitch_images` integrates functionality from `my_utils.stitch_images` to perform image stitching.
*   **Dependencies:** The server heavily relies on Flask for web handling, OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, and custom `model` and `my_utils` modules for ML inference, drawing, and image stitching.
*   **Accessibility:** The server is configured to run on `0.0.0.0:5001`, making it accessible from all network interfaces, suitable for communication with devices like a Raspberry Pi.

The overall pattern indicates a robust server-side component for a vision system, capable of real-time image recognition, annotation, and performance monitoring, designed to integrate with a larger system (likely a robot or edge device).
