# Activity Summary for 10/24/2025

## 2:34:21 PM
The `server_receive_image.py` file, last modified on October 24, 2025, at 2:12:21 PM, implements a Flask-based image recognition server.

Key functionalities include:

*   **Server Initialization:** It sets up a Flask application that loads a machine learning model (`model.load_model()`) at startup and creates `uploads` and `results` directories to manage incoming and processed images.
*   **`/status` Endpoint:** A GET endpoint `/status` provides a simple health check, confirming the server is running.
*   **`/upload` Endpoint:** This POST endpoint is designed to receive images from a client.
    *   It decodes the incoming image bytes using OpenCV (`cv2.imdecode`).
    *   It then utilizes the loaded model (`predict_image_labels`) to predict labels and bounding boxes within the image, with configurable `imgsz` and `conf` parameters.
    *   If detections are made, it annotates the image with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores using `my_utils.draw_bounding_box`.
    *   The processed (or original, if no detection) image is saved to the `results` folder with a timestamped filename.
    *   Crucially, this endpoint logs detailed performance timings for image decoding, prediction, and saving operations, providing insights into processing bottlenecks.
    *   It returns a JSON response indicating the processing status, whether the image was annotated, and the detected label.
*   **`/stitch_images` Endpoint:** A GET endpoint `/stitch_images` integrates functionality from `my_utils.stitch_images` to perform image stitching.
*   **Dependencies:** The server heavily relies on Flask for web handling, OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, and custom `model` and `my_utils` modules for ML inference, drawing, and image stitching.
*   **Accessibility:** The server is configured to run on `0.0.0.0:5001`, making it accessible from all network interfaces, suitable for communication with devices like a Raspberry Pi.

The overall pattern indicates a robust server-side component for a vision system, capable of real-time image recognition, annotation, and performance monitoring, designed to integrate with a larger system (likely a robot or edge device).

The provided log details significant updates to the `/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/MDP_Shared/MDP-Maxxing/RPI_Vision_V2/server_receive_image.py` file, with the last recorded change timestamped `10/24/2025, 2:12:21 PM`.

This Python file acts as a Flask-based image recognition server. Key functionalities include:

*   **Initialization:** Sets up `UPLOAD_FOLDER` and `RESULTS_FOLDER` directories for storing incoming images and their processed outputs. It loads a machine learning model using `load_model()` at startup.
*   **`/status` Endpoint (GET):** Provides a simple health check, returning a 200 status if the server is running.
*   **`/upload` Endpoint (POST):** This is the core image processing endpoint.
    *   Receives an image file, decodes it using OpenCV (`cv2.imdecode`).
    *   Performs object detection/labeling using `predict_image_labels` from the loaded model, with specific image size (`imgsz=416`) and confidence threshold (`conf=0.25`).
    *   If detections are found, it uses `draw_bounding_box` to annotate the image with labels and confidence scores.
    *   Saves either the annotated image (if detection occurred) or the raw image (if no detection) into the `RESULTS_FOLDER`, prepending a timestamp to the filename.
    *   Crucially, it logs detailed performance metrics for the decode, predict, and save operations, along with the total elapsed time, using `time.perf_counter()`.
    *   Returns a JSON response indicating success, whether the image was annotated, and the detected label.
*   **`/stitch_images` Endpoint (GET):** Calls a `stitch_images()` utility function, suggesting functionality for combining multiple images.
*   **Server Configuration:** The Flask application runs on host `0.0.0.0` and port `5001` in debug mode.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Design:** The server heavily relies on external modules for model loading, prediction (`model.py`), and utility functions like drawing bounding boxes and image stitching (`my_utils.draw_bounding_box`, `my_utils.stitch_images`).
*   **Performance Monitoring:** The explicit use of `time.perf_counter()` to measure and log decode, predict, and save durations within the `/upload` endpoint indicates a focus on optimizing and tracking performance.
*   **Robust File Handling:** Uses `secure_filename` for file safety and `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)` for directory creation, ensuring the server handles file uploads and storage gracefully.
*   **API-centric Communication:** All interactions are handled via Flask API endpoints, making it suitable for integration with other client-side applications (e.g., a Raspberry Pi as suggested by the path `RPI_Vision_V2`).
