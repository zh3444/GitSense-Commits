# Activity Summary for 10/12/2025

## 1:45:18 AM
The file `c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Server\plan.txt` details a procedural plan for an RPI-controlled STM (robot) involving sensor readings and movement commands.

**File-Specific Updates & Timestamps:**

*   **10/12/2025, 12:53:02 AM:** This version establishes core parameters for sensor ranges (ultrasound, IR, camera) and outlines the robot's operational logic in a `while True` loop. It begins by listening for a `<START>` command.
    *   **REGION A LOGIC:** Involves an initial forward movement (`FW110`) until the ultrasound sensor detects an obstacle within 40cm, followed by sending a `<SNAPS>` command. Subsequent movements are conditional on receiving `<LEFTS>` or `<RIGHT>` commands from RPI, leading to specific turning sequences (e.g., `FL090`, `FR180`).
    *   **REGION B LOGIC:** This section is complex, starting with a short forward movement (`FW020`) and another `<SNAPS>`. It features multiple `if/elif` conditions to handle various "edge cases" based on previously detected directions (`direction1`, `direction2`) and received arrow commands. These cases involve intricate sequences of forward movements (`FW050`, `FW200`, `FW150`) interspersed with 90 or 180-degree turns (`FL090`, `FR090`, `FL180`, `FR180`), often guided by IR sensor distance checks (e.g., `IR_RIGHT distance >= 40cm`). An `else` block for larger region B distances (>= 140cm) also includes movement and a `break` condition.

*   **10/12/2025, 1:06:48 AM:** A significant update occurred shortly after the initial plan, primarily simplifying the "REGION B LOGIC" and refining comments.
    *   The `distance` variable was added, initialized to `0`.
    *   The note for the camera's obstacle distance was clarified to include a "max range of 120cm".
    *   **REGION A LOGIC:** Remains functionally the same, but a comment "at this point, STM is in front of obstacle A" was added for clarity.
    *   **REGION B LOGIC:** This section underwent substantial simplification. The previous complex `if/elif` structure for "edge cases" based on `direction1` and `direction2` was removed. It was replaced with a more streamlined approach that directly responds to immediate `<LEFTS>` or `<RIGHT>` commands from RPI.
        *   The new logic for both left and right arrow detections involves a 90-degree turn, a longer forward movement (`FW100`) guided by the respective IR sensor, a 180-degree turn, a short `FW020` movement (explicitly noted to position the IR sensor), another forward movement (`FW150`) guided by IR, and a final 90-degree turn.
        *   A comment "at this point, STM is at pos Z" was added at the end of REGION B.
        *   The `break` statement is now positioned unconditionally at the end of the simplified REGION B.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Sensor-Driven Movement:** The plan heavily relies on sensor input (ultrasound, IR) to control movement termination (e.g., `once ultrasound distance < 40cm, terminate movement`).
*   **Command-Based Actions:** The robot's path is dynamically influenced by commands received from the RPI (e.g., `<START>`, `<LEFTS>`, `<RIGHT>`, `<SNAPS>`).
*   **Modular Logic:** The plan is conceptually divided into "REGION A LOGIC" and "REGION B LOGIC," indicating distinct phases of operation.
*   **Fine-Tuning Parameters:** Many numerical values for movement distances and angles are marked with `**`, suggesting they are placeholders intended for empirical tuning.
*   **Consistent Movement Nomenclature:** Commands like `stm move <FWxxx>` (forward), `stm move <FLxxx>` (turn left), `stm move <FRxxx>` (turn right) are used throughout.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The rapid changes between the two timestamps, particularly the simplification of REGION B, indicate an iterative development process aimed at refining and streamlining the robot's navigation strategy.
