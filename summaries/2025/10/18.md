# Activity Summary for 10/18/2025

## 3:56:15 PM
The code change log primarily details updates across three Python files, all located within `/Users/zhihao/Desktop/MDP_Shared/MDP-Maxxing/RPI_Vision_V2/`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/MDP_Shared/MDP-Maxxing/RPI_Vision_V2/server_receive_image2.py`**
    *   **Initial State (10/18/2025, 2:58:31 PM):** This file defines a Flask server for image recognition. It includes endpoints for `/status`, `/upload`, and `/stitch_images`. The `/upload` endpoint receives an image, decodes it using OpenCV, performs object detection using a loaded model, and then potentially annotates the image. Notably, it has specific logic to check for a "snap_2" form field and only annotates if the detected label is '38' or '39'. It runs on port 5001. It initially imported `PIL.Image` and `my_utils.send_annotated_images`.
    *   **Cleanup and Refinement (10/18/2025, 3:00:05 PM - 3:00:11 PM):** The `send_annotated_images` import was removed. A temporary typo in the `PIL` import (`fro` instead of `from PIL import Image`) was introduced and quickly corrected.
    *   **Further Cleanup (10/18/2025, 3:31:04 PM):** The `PIL.Image` import was entirely removed, suggesting it's no longer necessary for the server's operation. The core logic, including the "snap_2" check and conditional annotation for labels '38' or '39', remained consistent.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/MDP_Shared/MDP-Maxxing/RPI_Vision_V2/model.py`**
    *   **Core Functionality (10/18/2025, 3:06:35 PM):** This file is responsible for the machine learning aspects. It contains functions to `load_model` (specifically YOLOv5, attempting to load from local source, cache, or cloning the repository), convert various image formats to BGR NumPy arrays (`_to_numpy_bgr`), retrieve label maps (`get_label_map`), and `predict_image_labels`. The prediction logic processes YOLOv5 results, extracts bounding boxes, confidences, and class IDs, and includes a specific filtering step to drop "marker" labels if multiple detections occur, then selects the detection with the largest bounding box area.
    *   **Minor Addition (10/18/2025, 3:06:58 PM):** The `pathlib` module was imported, and commented-out lines relating to `pathlib.PosixPath` for Windows compatibility were added, along with a clarifying comment. This indicates consideration for cross-platform execution, though the specific workaround remains disabled.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/MDP_Shared/MDP-Maxxing/RPI_Vision_V2/server_receive_image.py`**
    *   **New Server Variant (10/18/2025, 3:30:43 PM):** This appears to be a separate, but very similar, Flask server file. Key differences from `server_receive_image2.py` are: it runs on port 5000, lacks the `snap_2` form field check, and unconditionally annotates any detected object (it does not filter for labels '38' or '39' for annotation). It initially imported `PIL.Image`, `io`, and `my_utils.send_annotated_images`.
    *   **Import Cleanup (10/18/2025, 3:31:12 PM - 3:31:28 PM):** Similar to `server_receive_image2.py`, `my_utils.send_annotated_images` was removed. Subsequently, the `io` module import was also removed. The `PIL.Image` import was retained in this file.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/18/2025, 3:00:05 PM - 3:00:11 PM:** `server_receive_image2.py` underwent initial import cleanup, specifically removing `send_annotated_images` and fixing a minor syntax error.
*   **10/18/2025, 3:06:58 PM:** `model.py` was updated to include `pathlib` and comments for potential Windows compatibility, highlighting attention to portability.
*   **10/18/2025, 3:31:04 PM:** `server_receive_image2.py` had a further import `PIL.Image` removed.
*   **10/18/2025, 3:31:12 PM - 3:31:28 PM:** `server_receive_image.py` had its own set of import cleanups, removing `send_annotated_images` and `io`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Server Duplication/Variation:** There are two distinct Flask server files (`server_receive_image.py` and `server_receive_image2.py`), each serving a similar purpose but with minor functional differences (e.g., port number, specific request handling logic, and annotation criteria). This suggests parallel development, A/B testing, or different deployment targets for these server configurations.
*   **Consistent Core Logic:** Both server files share a common structure: receiving images, using `cv2.imdecode` for processing, calling `predict_image_labels` from `model.py`, drawing bounding boxes, and saving results to a `results` folder with timestamps. Both also expose a `/status` and `/stitch_images` endpoint.
*   **Import Cleanup:** A recurring pattern is the removal of imports like `PIL.Image`, `io`, and `my_utils.send_annotated_images` across the server files. This indicates a general effort to streamline dependencies and clean up unused code, possibly reflecting a shift in how images are handled or processed downstream.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Both server files include detailed `time.perf_counter()` measurements to log the duration of decoding, prediction, and saving steps, indicating a focus on optimizing execution speed.
*   **YOLOv5 Integration:** The `model.py` file demonstrates robust integration with YOLOv5, handling model loading, inference, and specific post-processing logic for detections (e.g., dropping "marker" labels and selecting the largest area).
