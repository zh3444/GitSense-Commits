# Activity Summary for 10/23/2025

## 1:27:54 PM
The logged changes describe the setup of a `log4shell-demo` project, likely for educational or testing purposes, focusing on the Log4j vulnerability. All modifications occurred on 10/23/2025, within a concise period from 12:45 PM to 1:11 PM, indicating a single concentrated development session.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4shell-demo/pom.xml`**:
    *   **Initial setup (12:45:06 PM):** The project was initialized as a Maven project `log4shell-sim`, configured for Java 11, and included the `maven-shade-plugin` to create a fat jar with `com.demo.VulnServer` as the main class.
    *   **Significant update (1:05:09 PM):** The `artifactId` was changed to `log4j-demo`. Crucially, dependencies for `log4j-api` and `log4j-core` (version 2.14.1) were added, explicitly noted as "Vulnerable Log4j for demo (run ONLY in isolated lab)," highlighting the project's purpose.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4shell-demo/log4j2.xml` (1:05:57 PM):**
    *   A new Log4j configuration file was added. It defines a basic `Console` appender with a standard pattern layout and sets the `Root` logger level to `info`.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4shell-demo/src/main/java/com/VulnServer.java` (1:08:26 PM):**
    *   A new Java file `VulnServer` was introduced. This class sets up an HTTP server listening on `127.0.0.1:8080`.
    *   It logs the `User-Agent` header of incoming requests using the configured Log4j logger (`logger.info("Received User-Agent: " + ua)`), demonstrating where untrusted input could trigger the Log4j vulnerability.
    *   A critical safety mechanism is noted: instead of relying on Log4j's JNDI/remote classloading, it explicitly calls `SafeLoader.tryHandleLookup(ua)` for a controlled demonstration.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4shell-demo/src/main/java/com/demo/SafeLoader.java` (1:09:29 PM):**
    *   This new `SafeLoader` class is central to the controlled demonstration. It uses a regex to identify JNDI lookup patterns in an input string.
    *   **Key safety feature:** It strictly whitelists the URL from which a class can be loaded to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ExploitClass.class`. Any other URL is rejected.
    *   It includes functionality to fetch class bytes from the allowed URL and load them using a custom `ClassLoader`, then instantiates the loaded class to confirm execution.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4shell-demo/exploit/ExploitClass.java` (1:11:12 PM):**
    *   A new `ExploitClass` file (without a package) was added in an `exploit` directory. This class contains `static` and constructor blocks that print messages, serving as a benign payload to confirm successful loading and execution within the `SafeLoader`'s controlled environment.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes consistently highlight a focus on demonstrating the Log4j vulnerability in a **controlled and safe manner**. This is evident through:
*   Explicit comments in `pom.xml` ("run ONLY in isolated lab").
*   The `VulnServer` bypassing direct Log4j JNDI handling in favor of `SafeLoader`.
*   The `SafeLoader`'s strict URL whitelisting (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/ExploitClass.class`).
*   The `ExploitClass` being labeled as "benign".

The project utilizes Maven for dependency management and building, including the `maven-shade-plugin` to create an executable jar. The development activity was concentrated within a short timeframe on a single day.
