# Activity Summary for 10/14/2025

## 10:38:44 AM

The logs indicate development activity across two Python files within a project structured around a Raspberry Pi server and an image vision component.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

1.  **`c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Server\Week9.py`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/14/2025, 9:58:18 AM to 10/14/2025, 10:12:02 AM
    *   **Summary:** Across all recorded entries for this file, the provided code snippet remains identical. This segment defines the `RaspberryPi` class, handling core functionalities like camera control, STM (microcontroller) communication, and Android device interaction. Key methods include `start`, `stop`, `send_and_wait` for STM commands, and `android_io_process` for managing Android communication threads (`recv_android`, `send_android`). It also includes `rpi_queue_listener` and `stm_queue_listener` for processing commands and image capture/object detection logic (`take_snapshot`, image upload to `IMAGE_SERVER`). The snippet ends abruptly, making it unclear if changes occurred in other parts of the file not included in the log.

2.  **`c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Vision\server_receive_image.py`**
    *   **Initial State (10/14/2025, 10:00:35 AM):** The image recognition server processes uploaded images. It uses `cv2.imdecode` for faster image loading, predicts labels using a model with a confidence threshold (`conf=0.75`), draws bounding boxes if detections are found, and saves both the raw uploaded image to an `uploads` folder and annotated images (or raw if no detection) to a `results` folder.
    *   **Significant Change (10/14/2025, 10:00:43 AM):** The confidence threshold for image prediction (`conf`) was lowered from `0.75` to `0.25`. This change suggests an attempt to make the object detection more sensitive, potentially to catch more objects, even if with lower confidence.
    *   **Significant Change (10/14/2025, 10:04:27 AM):** The code responsible for saving the original raw image to the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` was commented out. This indicates an optimization or change in storage policy, where only the results (annotated or raw if no detection) are saved to the `RESULTS_FOLDER`, potentially to save disk space or streamline the workflow.
    *   **Final State (10/14/2025, 10:04:52 AM):** The code remains consistent with the changes made at 10:04:27 AM, maintaining the `0.25` confidence threshold and not saving raw uploads to the `UPLOAD_FOLDER`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Image Processing and Communication:** Both files are integral to a system that captures images from a Raspberry Pi, sends them to a vision server for processing, and communicates results back to an Android device and an STM microcontroller.
*   **Optimization Attempts:** The `server_receive_image.py` file shows direct attempts at optimizing the image processing pipeline by adjusting the confidence threshold for object detection and by removing the redundant saving of raw uploaded images, likely to improve performance or resource usage.
*   **Modularity:** The system is designed with distinct components for hardware interaction (Raspberry Pi server), image recognition (vision server), and communication (AndroidLink, STMLink).
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Both files extensively use logging (`self.logger.info`, `self.logger.debug`, `self.logger.error`) and include `try-except` blocks for robust operation and debugging.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** The `Week9.py` file utilizes `threading` and `multiprocessing.Process` for concurrent operations (e.g., Android I/O, STM receiving, RPI/STM queue listeners), indicating a responsive, event-driven architecture.

## 12:38:41 PM
The provided log primarily details changes to a single file: `c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Vision\server_receive_image.py`. This Flask-based Python server is designed for image recognition, handling image uploads, processing them, and storing results.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Vision\server_receive_image.py`**:
    *   This file defines a Flask application with endpoints such as `/status`, `/upload`, `/retrieve_annotations`, and `/stitch_images`.
    *   The `/upload` endpoint is central, responsible for receiving an image, decoding it using OpenCV (`cv2.imdecode`), predicting labels using a loaded model (`predict_image_labels`), drawing bounding boxes, and saving either annotated or raw images to a `results` folder.
    *   The initial version at **10/14/2025, 12:22:27 PM** used `time.time()` for measuring the total execution time of the `/upload` endpoint. It also contained commented-out code for PIL-based image processing, indicating a prior shift to an OpenCV-based workflow for speed.
    *   The entry at **10/14/2025, 12:22:36 PM** shows no functional changes; the code is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   A significant update occurred at **10/14/2025, 12:23:18 PM**, where the performance timing mechanism within the `/upload` endpoint was changed from `time.time()` to `time.perf_counter()` for more precise measurements.
    *   Further refinement was made at **10/14/2025, 12:27:15 PM**. This update introduced granular performance logging within the `/upload` function, specifically timing the image decoding (`cv2.imdecode`), prediction (`predict_image_labels`), and result saving stages. The output now includes a detailed breakdown of these individual step times in seconds.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/14/2025, 12:23:18 PM**: Switched to `time.perf_counter()` for more accurate performance measurement.
*   **10/14/2025, 12:27:15 PM**: Implemented detailed step-by-step timing within the image processing pipeline, logging decode, predict, and save times individually.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

A clear pattern throughout these changes is a strong emphasis on **performance optimization and precise measurement** within the image recognition pipeline. This is evidenced by:
1.  The initial commented-out PIL code, explicitly mentioning "test new workflow to speed up image rec pipeline."
2.  The subsequent switch from `time.time()` to the higher-resolution `time.perf_counter()`.
3.  The final introduction of granular timing for specific stages (decode, predict, save) to pinpoint bottlenecks and provide actionable performance insights. The repeated "INFO" logs related to timing also underscore this focus.
