# Activity Summary for 10/14/2025

## 10:38:44 AM

The logs indicate development activity across two Python files within a project structured around a Raspberry Pi server and an image vision component.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

1.  **`c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Server\Week9.py`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/14/2025, 9:58:18 AM to 10/14/2025, 10:12:02 AM
    *   **Summary:** Across all recorded entries for this file, the provided code snippet remains identical. This segment defines the `RaspberryPi` class, handling core functionalities like camera control, STM (microcontroller) communication, and Android device interaction. Key methods include `start`, `stop`, `send_and_wait` for STM commands, and `android_io_process` for managing Android communication threads (`recv_android`, `send_android`). It also includes `rpi_queue_listener` and `stm_queue_listener` for processing commands and image capture/object detection logic (`take_snapshot`, image upload to `IMAGE_SERVER`). The snippet ends abruptly, making it unclear if changes occurred in other parts of the file not included in the log.

2.  **`c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Vision\server_receive_image.py`**
    *   **Initial State (10/14/2025, 10:00:35 AM):** The image recognition server processes uploaded images. It uses `cv2.imdecode` for faster image loading, predicts labels using a model with a confidence threshold (`conf=0.75`), draws bounding boxes if detections are found, and saves both the raw uploaded image to an `uploads` folder and annotated images (or raw if no detection) to a `results` folder.
    *   **Significant Change (10/14/2025, 10:00:43 AM):** The confidence threshold for image prediction (`conf`) was lowered from `0.75` to `0.25`. This change suggests an attempt to make the object detection more sensitive, potentially to catch more objects, even if with lower confidence.
    *   **Significant Change (10/14/2025, 10:04:27 AM):** The code responsible for saving the original raw image to the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` was commented out. This indicates an optimization or change in storage policy, where only the results (annotated or raw if no detection) are saved to the `RESULTS_FOLDER`, potentially to save disk space or streamline the workflow.
    *   **Final State (10/14/2025, 10:04:52 AM):** The code remains consistent with the changes made at 10:04:27 AM, maintaining the `0.25` confidence threshold and not saving raw uploads to the `UPLOAD_FOLDER`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Image Processing and Communication:** Both files are integral to a system that captures images from a Raspberry Pi, sends them to a vision server for processing, and communicates results back to an Android device and an STM microcontroller.
*   **Optimization Attempts:** The `server_receive_image.py` file shows direct attempts at optimizing the image processing pipeline by adjusting the confidence threshold for object detection and by removing the redundant saving of raw uploaded images, likely to improve performance or resource usage.
*   **Modularity:** The system is designed with distinct components for hardware interaction (Raspberry Pi server), image recognition (vision server), and communication (AndroidLink, STMLink).
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Both files extensively use logging (`self.logger.info`, `self.logger.debug`, `self.logger.error`) and include `try-except` blocks for robust operation and debugging.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** The `Week9.py` file utilizes `threading` and `multiprocessing.Process` for concurrent operations (e.g., Android I/O, STM receiving, RPI/STM queue listeners), indicating a responsive, event-driven architecture.
