# Activity Summary for 10/27/2025

## 9:42:46 AM
The provided log details changes to two distinct Dockerfiles, both updated on October 27, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4j-shell-poc/Dockerfile`**:
    *   This Dockerfile, first recorded at 8:57:59 AM, defines an image based on `tomcat:8.5-jre8`. It is configured to deploy a `log4shell-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war` file as the root web application, exposes port 8080, and starts Tomcat using `catalina.sh`. An earlier commented-out line indicates a potential prior use of `tomcat:8.0.36-jre8`. This appears to be setting up an environment for a Log4j shell exploit proof-of-concept.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4j-test/Dockerfile`**:
    *   This Dockerfile, with its initial content recorded at 9:39:10 AM and an identical subsequent entry at 9:39:55 AM, employs a multi-stage build process for a Java application.
        *   The first stage, named `builder`, uses `maven:3.8.8-openjdk-8` to compile the `pom.xml` and `src` directory into a `log4j-test-1.0.jar`.
        *   The second stage uses `eclipse-temurin:8-jre` as its base, copies the compiled JAR from the builder stage, exposes port 8080, and executes the Java application with `java -jar /app/app.jar`. This Dockerfile seems dedicated to building and running a test application related to Log4j.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

All changes occurred on October 27, 2025. The `log4j-shell-poc` Dockerfile was updated at 8:57:59 AM. The `log4j-test` Dockerfile saw its content first introduced at 9:39:10 AM, with an identical save or minor unlogged change recorded at 9:39:55 AM, suggesting a period of active work within the hour.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Log4j Focus:** Both projects (`log4j-shell-poc` and `log4j-test`) are explicitly named in a way that indicates a direct relation to the Log4j vulnerability, either for exploitation demonstration or testing purposes.
*   **Docker Containerization:** All entries involve `Dockerfile`s, highlighting a consistent approach to containerizing these applications using Docker.
*   **Java Applications:** Both setups are for Java-based applications, one deploying a WAR to Tomcat and the other building and running a JAR directly.
*   **Port Exposure:** Both Dockerfiles expose port 8080, which is a common default port for web servers and Java applications.
*   **Focused Development:** All timestamps fall on the same day, suggesting a concentrated development effort on Log4j-related Docker configurations.

## 10:42:51 AM
The provided log details changes across two distinct projects related to Log4j: `log4j-shell-poc` and `log4j-test`. All recorded modifications occurred on `10/27/2025`, indicating active development or setup within a short timeframe.

**Key Changes by File:**

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4j-shell-poc/Dockerfile`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `10/27/2025, 8:57:59 AM`
    *   **Description:** This Dockerfile sets up a Tomcat 8.5-jre8 container. It removes default web applications and deploys `log4shell-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war` as the ROOT application. Port 8080 is exposed, and Tomcat is started via `catalina.sh`. An older `FROM tomcat:8.0.36-jre8` instruction is commented out.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4j-test/Dockerfile`**
    *   **Timestamps:** `10/27/2025, 9:39:10 AM`, `10/27/2025, 9:39:55 AM`, `10/27/2025, 9:47:08 AM`
    *   **Description:** This Dockerfile underwent several iterations within a few minutes.
        *   The initial versions (`9:39:10 AM` and `9:39:55 AM`, which are identical) implemented a multi-stage build. It used `maven:3.8.8-openjdk-8` to build a Java application (`log4j-test-1.0.jar`) and then copied this artifact into a smaller `eclipse-temurin:8-jre` image.
        *   A later change at `9:47:08 AM` simplified the Dockerfile to a single-stage build. This version directly used `eclipse-temurin:8-jre` and copied an already compiled `log4j-test-1.0.jar` into the image, implying the build step is expected to happen externally or in a prior process not shown.
        *   Across all versions, the Dockerfile consistently exposes port 8080 and specifies `java -jar /app/app.jar` as the command to run the application.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4j-test/src/main/java/local/log4j/ExampleServer.java`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `10/27/2025, 10:21:58 AM`
    *   **Description:** This Java source file defines an `ExampleServer` that implements a minimal HTTP server. Its primary function, as noted in the comments, is to explicitly log the value of the "X-Api-Version" HTTP header using `org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger.info()`. This is highlighted as the "important logging call that will trigger Log4j lookups," indicating its role in testing Log4j behavior, likely related to known vulnerabilities. The server handles GET and HEAD requests on port 8080, returning "OK\n" for GET and only headers for HEAD. It includes a cautionary note about running it only in a controlled, local test environment.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Log4j Testing Focus:** Both projects (`log4j-shell-poc` and `log4j-test`) are explicitly named and designed for purposes related to Log4j, strongly suggesting testing or demonstration of Log4j vulnerabilities (like shell exploits or lookup evaluation).
*   **Containerization with Docker:** All applications are packaged and managed using Dockerfiles, indicating a preference for isolated and reproducible test environments.
*   **Java 8 Environment:** The projects consistently target Java 8 (JRE 8, OpenJDK 8, eclipse-temurin:8-jre), which is common for Log4j vulnerability contexts.
*   **Port 8080 Exposure:** Both Dockerfiles consistently expose port 8080, indicating that the applications are designed to be accessed via HTTP on this standard port.
*   **HTTP Server Functionality:** The `ExampleServer.java` code explicitly creates an HTTP server, reinforcing that the testing involves HTTP interactions to trigger Log4j logging.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The multiple timestamps for the `log4j-test/Dockerfile` within a short period suggest rapid development or troubleshooting of the build process.

## 11:42:52 AM
The changes log details development across two distinct Log4j-related projects: `log4j-shell-poc` and `log4j-test`, with all activity occurring on October 27, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4j-shell-poc/Dockerfile` (8:57:59 AM):** This Dockerfile configures a Tomcat server (specifically `tomcat:8.5-jre8`, updated from a commented-out `8.0.36` version). It removes default web applications and deploys `log4shell-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war` as the `ROOT.war`, exposing port 8080. This setup appears to be a proof-of-concept environment for Log4j shell vulnerabilities.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4j-test/Dockerfile`:** This file underwent several revisions for the `log4j-test` project:
    *   **9:39:10 AM & 9:39:55 AM:** Initially, it was a multi-stage Dockerfile. The first stage (`builder`) used `maven:3.8.8-openjdk-8` to build a Java application from `pom.xml` and `src` directory, resulting in `log4j-test-1.0.jar`. The second stage used `eclipse-temurin:8-jre` to create a lightweight runtime image by copying the built JAR, exposing port 8080, and running it with `java -jar`. The two timestamps show identical content, suggesting a minor save without functional change.
    *   **9:47:08 AM:** This Dockerfile was significantly simplified. It was refactored to a single-stage build using only `eclipse-temurin:8-jre`. It directly copies `target/log4j-test-1.0.jar`, implying the build process is expected to happen outside the Docker build context. It continues to expose port 8080 and run the JAR.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4j-test/src/main/java/local/log4j/ExampleServer.java` (10:21:58 AM):** This Java source file introduces a minimal HTTP server (`com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`). Its primary function is to explicitly log the value of the `X-Api-Version` HTTP header using `org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger.info()`. The code includes a critical comment highlighting that this specific logging call is intended to "trigger Log4j lookups," indicating its role in testing Log4j vulnerabilities. It handles GET (returning "OK") and HEAD requests and contains a warning to "Run only in a controlled, local test environment."

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/27/2025, 8:57:59 AM:** Initial setup of the `log4j-shell-poc` Dockerfile, demonstrating a Log4j vulnerability proof-of-concept.
*   **10/27/2025, 9:47:08 AM:** A key architectural change in the `log4j-test` Dockerfile, simplifying its build process from multi-stage to single-stage.
*   **10/27/2025, 10:21:58 AM:** The introduction of the `ExampleServer.java` file, which contains the core logic for intentionally triggering Log4j lookups, likely for vulnerability testing within the `log4j-test` project.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Log4j Vulnerability Context:** All changes are centered around projects explicitly named with "log4j" and involve code (e.g., `ExampleServer.java`) designed to demonstrate or test Log4j lookups, strongly suggesting an emphasis on security research or vulnerability testing related to Log4j (likely Log4Shell).
*   **Containerization with Docker:** Both `log4j-shell-poc` and `log4j-test` projects utilize Dockerfiles, indicating that containerized environments are used for building, deploying, and testing these applications.
*   **Java-based Applications:** Both projects are Java-based, using either Tomcat with a WAR file or a standalone Java application (JAR) run with `java -jar`.
*   **Port 8080 Exposure:** Across all Dockerfile configurations, port 8080 is consistently exposed, suggesting it's the standard communication port for these applications.
*   **Testing/POC Nature:** The explicit logging of `X-Api-Version` to trigger Log4j lookups and the "controlled, local test environment" warning in `ExampleServer.java` reinforce the experimental and testing nature of these code changes.
