# Activity Summary for 10/27/2025

## 9:42:46 AM
The provided log details changes to two distinct Dockerfiles, both updated on October 27, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4j-shell-poc/Dockerfile`**:
    *   This Dockerfile, first recorded at 8:57:59 AM, defines an image based on `tomcat:8.5-jre8`. It is configured to deploy a `log4shell-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war` file as the root web application, exposes port 8080, and starts Tomcat using `catalina.sh`. An earlier commented-out line indicates a potential prior use of `tomcat:8.0.36-jre8`. This appears to be setting up an environment for a Log4j shell exploit proof-of-concept.

*   **`/Users/zhihao/Desktop/NTU/SC3010/log4j-test/Dockerfile`**:
    *   This Dockerfile, with its initial content recorded at 9:39:10 AM and an identical subsequent entry at 9:39:55 AM, employs a multi-stage build process for a Java application.
        *   The first stage, named `builder`, uses `maven:3.8.8-openjdk-8` to compile the `pom.xml` and `src` directory into a `log4j-test-1.0.jar`.
        *   The second stage uses `eclipse-temurin:8-jre` as its base, copies the compiled JAR from the builder stage, exposes port 8080, and executes the Java application with `java -jar /app/app.jar`. This Dockerfile seems dedicated to building and running a test application related to Log4j.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

All changes occurred on October 27, 2025. The `log4j-shell-poc` Dockerfile was updated at 8:57:59 AM. The `log4j-test` Dockerfile saw its content first introduced at 9:39:10 AM, with an identical save or minor unlogged change recorded at 9:39:55 AM, suggesting a period of active work within the hour.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Log4j Focus:** Both projects (`log4j-shell-poc` and `log4j-test`) are explicitly named in a way that indicates a direct relation to the Log4j vulnerability, either for exploitation demonstration or testing purposes.
*   **Docker Containerization:** All entries involve `Dockerfile`s, highlighting a consistent approach to containerizing these applications using Docker.
*   **Java Applications:** Both setups are for Java-based applications, one deploying a WAR to Tomcat and the other building and running a JAR directly.
*   **Port Exposure:** Both Dockerfiles expose port 8080, which is a common default port for web servers and Java applications.
*   **Focused Development:** All timestamps fall on the same day, suggesting a concentrated development effort on Log4j-related Docker configurations.
