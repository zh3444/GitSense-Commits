# Activity Summary for 10/8/2025

## 1:39:10 PM
The log details changes to Python dependency management files, specifically `requirements.txt`, for two iterations of a vision project.

The first significant change occurred on `10/8/2025, 12:41:18 PM` in `c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Vision\requirements.txt`. This file listed a basic set of unversioned dependencies: `flask`, `werkzeug`, `pillow`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, and `ultralytics`. These indicate an initial setup for a web-enabled application with image processing and deep learning capabilities.

A subsequent, more detailed update followed shortly after, at `10/8/2025, 12:49:40 PM`, in `c:\Users\zhiha\MDP_Shared\MDP-Maxxing\RPI_Vision_V2\requirements.txt`. This update represents a shift to a more controlled environment, introducing explicit versioning for all core dependencies such as `flask==3.0.3`, `werkzeug==3.0.3`, `numpy==1.26.4`, `pillow==10.2.0`, and `opencv-python==4.10.0.84`. Crucially, this version introduces PyTorch-related dependencies (`torch==2.2.2`, `torchvision==0.17.2`, `torchaudio==2.2.2`) and explicitly notes that `ultralytics` is no longer installed directly, with YOLOv5 loading via `torch.hub`. Additional utility libraries, `pathlib` and `typing-extensions>=4.5.0`, were also added.

Overall, the changes highlight a rapid evolution (within minutes) from a basic, unversioned set of dependencies for `RPI_Vision` to a more robust, version-locked, and PyTorch-centric dependency stack for `RPI_Vision_V2`. This indicates a transition to a more specific deep learning framework (PyTorch) for YOLOv5 integration, moving away from a direct `ultralytics` installation, and an emphasis on precise dependency management. Both files consistently focus on web services (Flask), image processing (Pillow, OpenCV), and deep learning.
