# Activity Summary for 8/30/2025

## 5:52:47 PM
The log shows changes to a client-server image processing system.  The client (`client_send_image.py`) underwent a minor update between 5:06:08 PM and 5:07:47 PM on August 30, 2025. This involved correcting a function call in the `main` function to include the `rawCapture` argument in the `capture_jpeg` function.

The server (`server_receive_image.py`) saw more substantial changes.  Between 5:33:38 PM and 5:42:22 PM on August 30, 2025, the `upload` function was significantly revised. The initial version used `file.stream` to open the image, then saved it before processing. The final version reads all bytes at once using `file.read()`, creates a PIL image from these bytes, processes the image using  `predict_image_labels_json`, and then saves the original bytes to disk. This change addresses potential issues with `file.stream` being consumed before image processing and improves efficiency. The response JSON was also modified to include parsed prediction results (`"pred": result_obj`) instead of a raw JSON string.  There were intermediate commits showing stages of this refactoring, ultimately leading to the inclusion of the `io` and `json` modules.  The server uses Flask to handle image uploads, saving images to a dedicated `uploads` folder. A gallery view (`/view`) is implemented to display uploaded images.
