# Activity Summary for 8/30/2025

## 5:52:47 PM
The log shows changes to a client-server image processing system.  The client (`client_send_image.py`) underwent a minor update between 5:06:08 PM and 5:07:47 PM on August 30, 2025. This involved correcting a function call in the `main` function to include the `rawCapture` argument in the `capture_jpeg` function.

The server (`server_receive_image.py`) saw more substantial changes.  Between 5:33:38 PM and 5:42:22 PM on August 30, 2025, the `upload` function was significantly revised. The initial version used `file.stream` to open the image, then saved it before processing. The final version reads all bytes at once using `file.read()`, creates a PIL image from these bytes, processes the image using  `predict_image_labels_json`, and then saves the original bytes to disk. This change addresses potential issues with `file.stream` being consumed before image processing and improves efficiency. The response JSON was also modified to include parsed prediction results (`"pred": result_obj`) instead of a raw JSON string.  There were intermediate commits showing stages of this refactoring, ultimately leading to the inclusion of the `io` and `json` modules.  The server uses Flask to handle image uploads, saving images to a dedicated `uploads` folder. A gallery view (`/view`) is implemented to display uploaded images.


## 10:06:16 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `server_receive_image.py` and `model.py` between 9:11 PM and 9:42 PM on August 30, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is improving the image processing and object detection within the Flask-based inference server.


**`server_receive_image.py` Changes:**

* **Initial Version (9:11 PM):** This version implemented a basic image upload functionality. It saved the uploaded image, ran predictions using a loaded model (`predict_image_labels_json` from `model.py`), and returned a JSON response.  The response initially included only basic information; a later version returns bounding boxes. There is also commented out code which seems to be previous iterations of the upload method.

* **Intermediate Versions (9:13 PM, 9:16 PM):** These versions added debugging print statements (`print('printing results ', r)`) to the `upload` function, aiding in identifying issues with the results from the prediction model.  No significant functional changes were made.

* **Import Added (9:18 PM):** `numpy` was added as an import to `server_receive_image.py` showing a necessity of using numpy for array manipulation.

* **Result Handling (9:21 PM, 9:24 PM, 9:25 PM):**  Significant changes were made to how the prediction results are handled. The code evolved from directly accessing attributes of the prediction results to parsing the JSON response, extracting bounding box information, and properly handling cases where no objects are detected.  The most significant change here was the consistent failure to access 'bbox' and 'names' attribute. There was repeated attempts to fix the issue which seems to have been solved by directly accessing those fields after JSON parsing in the version at 9:24 PM and 9:25 PM.


**`model.py` Changes:**

* **Initial Version (9:19 PM):** The `model.py` file defines functions for loading a YOLOv8 model (`load_model`), converting images to NumPy arrays (`_to_numpy_bgr`), and running inference and returning the results as a JSON string (`predict_image_labels_json`).  The primary function, `predict_image_labels_json` returns detection data which is utilized in `server_receive_image.py`.

* **Later Version (9:42 PM):**  A `print('hello from pil')` statement was added to the `_to_numpy_bgr` function, likely for debugging purposes. This indicates further refinement of the image processing pipeline.


**Overall Pattern:**

The changes reflect an iterative debugging and refinement process. Initial versions focused on establishing basic functionality. Subsequent commits concentrated on troubleshooting issues related to accessing and interpreting the object detection results, specifically dealing with variations in how the model returns these predictions. The addition of debugging print statements and adjustments in result parsing highlight this iterative approach. The changes were primarily focused on ensuring the server correctly receives, processes, and returns image predictions with bounding boxes.
