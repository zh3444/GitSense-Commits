# Activity Summary for 8/1/2025

## 5:13:39 PM
The log shows modifications to two files within a budget tracking application's email-worker component.  The primary focus is enhancing email processing and bank statement parsing using Google's Document AI.


**`processEmails.js` (8/1/2025, 4:19:43 PM):** This file processes emails containing transaction details.  It fetches user data, checks for valid Gmail refresh tokens, and retrieves emails matching a subject containing "transaction". The code then extracts transaction information from email bodies and attachments. If an attachment is a PDF or image, it's sent to `parseBankStatement` for processing.  A crucial aspect is updating the `lastEmailCheck` timestamp for each user to prevent reprocessing. The code includes functions for:

*   **`testTokenValidity`**: Checks the validity of a Gmail OAuth2 token.
*   **`extractTransactionFromText`**: Extracts transaction details (amount, date, merchant, category) from email body text using regular expressions.
*   **`getEmailBody`**: Extracts the email body from the payload, handling both plain text and HTML formats.
*   **`decodeSandwich`**: Decodes base64-encoded strings.


**`googleDocAI.js` (8/1/2025, 4:33:32 PM - 8/1/2025, 5:07:24 PM):** This file contains the `parseBankStatement` function which processes bank statement attachments using Google Document AI.  The function follows these steps:

1.  Saves the base64 encoded attachment to a temporary file.
2.  Uses the `DocumentProcessorServiceClient` to process the file.
3.  Calls `extractTransactionsFromDocument` to parse the results.
4.  Deletes the temporary file.

The `extractTransactionsFromDocument` function has undergone several revisions between 4:33 PM and 5:07 PM.  Initial versions focused on extracting data from tables assuming a three-column structure (date, description, amount).  Later versions (5:05 PM and subsequent) added significantly improved logging to show page dimensions, number of tables and form fields, header rows, and a preview of table data.  The latest revision also includes entity detection which analyzes the document for bank-specific data types.  This suggests iterative refinement to handle more varied bank statement layouts and improve accuracy.  The function now logs detected entity types and samples of each type, demonstrating a move towards more robust and adaptable parsing.
