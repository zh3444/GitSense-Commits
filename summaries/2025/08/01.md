# Activity Summary for 8/1/2025

## 5:13:39 PM
The log shows modifications to two files within a budget tracking application's email-worker component.  The primary focus is enhancing email processing and bank statement parsing using Google's Document AI.


**`processEmails.js` (8/1/2025, 4:19:43 PM):** This file processes emails containing transaction details.  It fetches user data, checks for valid Gmail refresh tokens, and retrieves emails matching a subject containing "transaction". The code then extracts transaction information from email bodies and attachments. If an attachment is a PDF or image, it's sent to `parseBankStatement` for processing.  A crucial aspect is updating the `lastEmailCheck` timestamp for each user to prevent reprocessing. The code includes functions for:

*   **`testTokenValidity`**: Checks the validity of a Gmail OAuth2 token.
*   **`extractTransactionFromText`**: Extracts transaction details (amount, date, merchant, category) from email body text using regular expressions.
*   **`getEmailBody`**: Extracts the email body from the payload, handling both plain text and HTML formats.
*   **`decodeSandwich`**: Decodes base64-encoded strings.


**`googleDocAI.js` (8/1/2025, 4:33:32 PM - 8/1/2025, 5:07:24 PM):** This file contains the `parseBankStatement` function which processes bank statement attachments using Google Document AI.  The function follows these steps:

1.  Saves the base64 encoded attachment to a temporary file.
2.  Uses the `DocumentProcessorServiceClient` to process the file.
3.  Calls `extractTransactionsFromDocument` to parse the results.
4.  Deletes the temporary file.

The `extractTransactionsFromDocument` function has undergone several revisions between 4:33 PM and 5:07 PM.  Initial versions focused on extracting data from tables assuming a three-column structure (date, description, amount).  Later versions (5:05 PM and subsequent) added significantly improved logging to show page dimensions, number of tables and form fields, header rows, and a preview of table data.  The latest revision also includes entity detection which analyzes the document for bank-specific data types.  This suggests iterative refinement to handle more varied bank statement layouts and improve accuracy.  The function now logs detected entity types and samples of each type, demonstrating a move towards more robust and adaptable parsing.


## 9:35:17 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `googleDocAI.js` file between 8:43 PM and 9:00 PM on August 1st, 2025.  The file uses the Google Cloud Document AI API to process bank statements.

The core functionality remains consistent throughout the changes: the code takes a base64 encoded bank statement, saves it temporarily, processes it using the Document AI client, extracts transactions via the `extractTransactionsFromDocument` function, and returns them.

The modifications focus on enhancing the logging and debugging within the `extractTransactionsFromDocument` function.

* **8:43 PM:** The initial version includes extensive logging statements displaying page dimensions, table structures (headers and rows), and detected entities.  The commented-out code suggests an earlier attempt at directly extracting transaction data from tables based on assumed column positions.

* **8:44 PM:**  The logging is improved, providing clearer formatting for page information (e.g., using `=== PAGE ${pageIndex + 1} ===`). Minor code cleanup involves adding optional chaining (`?.`) to handle potential null values in the object properties.

* **8:58 PM and 8:59 PM:**  These commits add logging of the `document.text` length and then a snippet of the `document.text` (first 500 characters) to aid in debugging text extraction.

* **9:00 PM:** The final commit adds logging of the `result.processorType` after the document processing to further clarify which Document AI processor was utilized.

In summary, the changes do not alter the fundamental functionality but significantly improve the logging and debugging capabilities to help understand the processing of the bank statements and troubleshoot any issues related to text extraction and data parsing.  No changes were made to the core logic of transaction extraction.
