# Activity Summary for 8/27/2025

## 4:44:58 PM
The log shows the development of a synthetic image generation script (`make_det_synth.py`) and a related script for image preprocessing (`auto_crop_symbols.py`).

`auto_crop_symbols.py` (8/27/2025, 3:45:31 PM): This script processes images from a directory ("dataset/symbols_raw_uncropped"), removing backgrounds using the `rembg` library and saving the cropped symbols to "dataset/symbols_crops," organized by class.  It supports various image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, bmp, webp).

`make_det_synth.py` undergoes several revisions on August 27th, 2025:

* **4:11:11 PM and 4:11:17 PM:**  Early versions of `make_det_synth.py` generate synthetic images for object detection. They use manually cropped symbols from "dataset/symbols_crops" and optional background images from "dataset/backgrounds."  The script creates YOLO-format training and validation datasets ("dataset/synth").  A key change between these two timestamps is the removal of the `BG_DIR` comment, potentially indicating a shift away from using external background images.

* **4:12:55 PM and 4:13:07 PM:**  Significant changes occur here.  The script now generates synthetic backgrounds instead of relying on external image files.  Three background generation functions (`bg_solid`, `bg_gradient`, `bg_noise`) are added. The code is better structured with comments separating logical sections (background makers, paste utils, prepare output directories, main loop).  The `random_bg` function now randomly selects from these three background generators.

* **4:13:23 PM:** This version is almost identical to the previous one, with only minor adjustments in the main generation loop, potentially related to bug fixes or minor efficiency improvements.  The script generates 2000 images with 1-3 objects per image, with 15% allocated for validation.

* **4:38:42 PM:** A major revision introduces considerably more sophisticated background generation and object augmentation capabilities. The script now incorporates numerous options for background creation (solid, colored, linear gradients, radial gradients, noise, checkerboard, stripes, polygons, textures, and real images if `BG_DIR` is specified), alongside expanded symbol augmentations (rotation, shear, perspective warping, blur, noise, contrast/brightness, HSV adjustments, gamma correction, shadow simulation, and cutout).  Many hyperparameters are clearly defined at the start of the script.  The number of generated images is increased to 3500.

* **4:40:18 PM and 4:41:40 PM:** These final versions simplify the background generation to six types ("solid", "gradient", "noise", "checker", "stripes", "texture"), using simpler methods and fewer options compared to the previous version.  The number of images is reduced slightly to 3000, and object augmentation focuses on shear, perspective, brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue adjustments.  The overall structure is streamlined and the code is more concise.  The file path for the input symbols is updated from `symbol_crops` to `symbols_crops`.


The overall pattern shows an iterative development process, starting with a basic framework and gradually increasing complexity, then later simplifying to a more streamlined and efficient design.  The major changes involve background generation methods and the extent of object augmentation.  The consistent use of `numpy`, `opencv`, and `PIL` for image manipulation is evident throughout the revisions.
