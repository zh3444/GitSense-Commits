# Activity Summary for 8/31/2025

## 10:55:53 AM
The log shows development of an image inference server.  `draw_bounding_box.py` underwent several revisions between 10:06 AM and 10:41 AM, primarily focusing on refining the drawing of bounding boxes and associated labels onto images. Initially, the code handled multiple bounding boxes; however, by 10:41 AM, it was simplified to handle only a single bounding box at a time.

The `server_receive_image.py` file was significantly altered between 10:17 AM and 10:55 AM.  The key changes involved improving image handling (reading all bytes at once instead of using streams) and handling prediction results. Early versions contained commented-out code, showing an iterative development process.  Around 10:31 AM, the `get_label_map` function was integrated from the `model.py` file, improving label management in bounding box drawing.  Crucially, at 10:54 AM and 10:55 AM, error handling was added to gracefully manage cases where no objects were detected in an image.  The server saves both original and annotated images to `uploads` and `results` folders respectively.

The `model.py` file was updated at 10:29 AM, introducing the `predict_image_labels_json` function that performs YOLOv8 inference and returns a JSON list of detected objects, each with class ID, label, confidence, and bounding box coordinates.  The helper functions `_to_numpy_bgr` (for image format conversion) and `get_label_map` (to get the class labels from the model) were added or improved in this update.  The model loading function also included a warmup step for better performance.


## 11:55:52 AM
The log shows development of a Flask-based image inference server.  The `server_receive_image.py` file underwent the most changes. Initially (10:56 AM), it handled image uploads, prediction using a YOLOv8 model (`model.py`), and displayed uploaded images. The image processing improved between 10:56 AM and 10:58 AM, switching to reading the entire image bytes at once instead of using a stream and improving the way result file names were timestamped.  The server now saves both the original image and an annotated version to disk.  The return value of the `/upload` endpoint was simplified to only return `{'ok':True}` at 10:58 AM, while earlier versions included the filename and URL.

At 11:02 AM, the `model.py` file was updated. This update focused on improving the model loading and prediction functions.  It now includes more robust error handling (for file not found), thread management for improved performance on resource-constrained devices, and uses Ultralytics YOLO library.  The `predict_image_labels_json` function now returns a list of dictionaries, each representing a detection with class_id, label, confidence, and bounding box.

Finally, at 11:51 AM, a new file, `send_annotated_images.py`, was added, creating a utility function to zip and send annotated images from the `RESULTS_FOLDER`.  This function is then used in `server_receive_image.py` (updated at 11:52 AM) to create a new endpoint `/retrieve_annotations` which returns a zip file of the results.  The main pattern in these changes is a progressive refinement of the image processing pipeline, moving from a simpler implementation towards a more efficient and robust system.  Error handling was enhanced throughout the code.
