# Activity Summary for 8/31/2025

## 10:55:53 AM
The log shows development of an image inference server.  `draw_bounding_box.py` underwent several revisions between 10:06 AM and 10:41 AM, primarily focusing on refining the drawing of bounding boxes and associated labels onto images. Initially, the code handled multiple bounding boxes; however, by 10:41 AM, it was simplified to handle only a single bounding box at a time.

The `server_receive_image.py` file was significantly altered between 10:17 AM and 10:55 AM.  The key changes involved improving image handling (reading all bytes at once instead of using streams) and handling prediction results. Early versions contained commented-out code, showing an iterative development process.  Around 10:31 AM, the `get_label_map` function was integrated from the `model.py` file, improving label management in bounding box drawing.  Crucially, at 10:54 AM and 10:55 AM, error handling was added to gracefully manage cases where no objects were detected in an image.  The server saves both original and annotated images to `uploads` and `results` folders respectively.

The `model.py` file was updated at 10:29 AM, introducing the `predict_image_labels_json` function that performs YOLOv8 inference and returns a JSON list of detected objects, each with class ID, label, confidence, and bounding box coordinates.  The helper functions `_to_numpy_bgr` (for image format conversion) and `get_label_map` (to get the class labels from the model) were added or improved in this update.  The model loading function also included a warmup step for better performance.


## 11:55:52 AM
The log shows development of a Flask-based image inference server.  The `server_receive_image.py` file underwent the most changes. Initially (10:56 AM), it handled image uploads, prediction using a YOLOv8 model (`model.py`), and displayed uploaded images. The image processing improved between 10:56 AM and 10:58 AM, switching to reading the entire image bytes at once instead of using a stream and improving the way result file names were timestamped.  The server now saves both the original image and an annotated version to disk.  The return value of the `/upload` endpoint was simplified to only return `{'ok':True}` at 10:58 AM, while earlier versions included the filename and URL.

At 11:02 AM, the `model.py` file was updated. This update focused on improving the model loading and prediction functions.  It now includes more robust error handling (for file not found), thread management for improved performance on resource-constrained devices, and uses Ultralytics YOLO library.  The `predict_image_labels_json` function now returns a list of dictionaries, each representing a detection with class_id, label, confidence, and bounding box.

Finally, at 11:51 AM, a new file, `send_annotated_images.py`, was added, creating a utility function to zip and send annotated images from the `RESULTS_FOLDER`.  This function is then used in `server_receive_image.py` (updated at 11:52 AM) to create a new endpoint `/retrieve_annotations` which returns a zip file of the results.  The main pattern in these changes is a progressive refinement of the image processing pipeline, moving from a simpler implementation towards a more efficient and robust system.  Error handling was enhanced throughout the code.


## 12:55:51 PM
The log shows development of an image processing and serving application.  The `send_annotated_images.py` file, responsible for zipping and sending annotated images, remained largely unchanged after the initial commit at 12:35:26 PM. A minor improvement at 12:42:31 PM  made the file path handling in `stitch_images` function more robust by using `Path(RESULTS_FOLDER).iterdir()` and converting the suffix to lowercase before comparison.

The main changes occurred in `server_receive_image.py` between 12:37:53 PM and the end of the log.  This file handles image uploads, prediction using a YOLO model, and displays uploaded images.  Initially, a commented-out section showed a simpler image processing and return pipeline. This was replaced with a more complete implementation that reads the image as bytes, converts it to a NumPy array for OpenCV processing, performs prediction using `predict_image_labels_json`, draws bounding boxes using `draw_bounding_box`, and saves the annotated image to the `RESULTS_FOLDER`. The final version also includes routes to retrieve annotations (`/retrieve_annotations`) and stitch images (`/stitch_images`), using functions from `send_annotated_images.py`.  The image gallery functionality was also added, showing uploaded images using a custom HTML template.  The updates to this file demonstrate a significant enhancement in image handling, prediction, annotation, and display capabilities.


## 3:48:42 PM
The log shows iterative development of a Python script (`client_send_image.py`) that captures images from a Raspberry Pi camera and uploads them to a server.

Initially (2:52:55 PM), the script directly hardcoded the server URL.  The `capture_jpeg` function was simpler, directly capturing and encoding the JPEG image without saving it locally.

Between 3:01:13 PM and 3:03:59 PM, an `.env` file was created and modified to manage the server URL, initially as `SERVER` and later changed to `SERVER_URL`.

At 3:04:09 PM and 3:04:25 PM, the script was updated to use the `dotenv` library to load the server URL from the `.env` file.  A minor code cleanup removed commented-out code.

The most significant changes occurred between 3:43:41 PM and 3:45:25 PM. The `capture_jpeg` function was substantially revised to:

1.  Add a `save_dir` argument to save images locally before uploading.
2.  Implement a more robust file writing approach using temporary files and `os.replace` to prevent data corruption.
3.  Add a timestamp to filenames.
4.  Print the local file save path.
5.  The function now returns both the in-memory byte stream and the local file path.


Throughout the log, the core functionality of capturing images, encoding them as JPEGs, and uploading them to a server remained consistent.  The key improvements focused on configuration management (using `.env`), error handling (more robust file I/O), and adding the capability to save images locally for debugging or further processing.  The final version at 3:45:25 PM represents the most complete and robust implementation.


## 4:48:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `client_send_image.py` between 3:52 PM and 3:59 PM on August 31, 2025.  The file is a Python script that captures images using a Raspberry Pi camera, encodes them as JPEGs, and sends them to a server via HTTP POST requests.

The main changes revolve around the `capture_jpeg` function, specifically how it handles file saving and returns the image data.

* **3:52 PM:** The initial version of `capture_jpeg` saves the image locally before converting to a byte stream for upload.  It includes error handling for JPEG encoding and uses a temporary file for atomicity.

* **3:56 PM - 3:56:47 PM:**  Minor edits were made in quick succession.  The first change at 3:56 PM had a syntax error in the `return` statement of `capture_jpeg`, with `s` left at the end. This was corrected in the subsequent version at 3:56:47 PM, removing the extra 's'.

* **3:59 PM:** The final revision simplifies the local file writing in `capture_jpeg`. Instead of creating a `save_path` variable and using it in file writing, the final version directly uses `save_path` in the `final_path` calculation (`final_path = save_path / filename`), making the code cleaner.  The core functionality of image capture, encoding, and upload remains consistent across all versions.  No functional changes were made to the main loop or server interaction logic.


## 5:48:41 PM
The log shows modifications to `client_send_image.py` on August 31st, 2025.  The file is a Python script that captures images using a Raspberry Pi camera, encodes them as JPEGs, and sends them to a server for upload.

The first two entries (5:03 PM and 5:04 PM) are identical, suggesting a potential accidental duplicate log entry.  No functional changes occurred between these timestamps.

The most significant change happens at 5:36:09 PM. The `capture_jpeg` function's error handling is improved. Instead of raising exceptions for JPEG encoding failures, it now returns a dictionary containing a status code (500 for error, 200 for success), a message, and the image data (or None for errors).  This change improves the robustness of the client by preventing crashes due to encoding problems.


The final change at 5:46:18 PM further refines the error handling. The main loop now checks the `status` field in the dictionary returned by `capture_jpeg`. If the status is not 200, it prints "Failed to capture image" instead of attempting to upload a potentially corrupt image.  This change directly addresses potential issues with the image capture process itself, rather than just focusing on the upload process.  In essence, the code now handles errors more gracefully and provides more informative feedback to the user.  Throughout all versions, the script uses the `dotenv` library to load environment variables, likely containing the server URL.


## 6:48:41 PM
The log shows updates to two Python files: `client_send_image.py` and `model.py`.  `client_send_image.py` was modified twice on August 31st, 2025. Both revisions pertain to a client application that captures images using a PiCamera, encodes them as JPEGs, and sends them to a server for processing.  The second revision (5:54:16 PM) includes a `# TODO amend this` comment in the section handling the server's response, suggesting ongoing development or debugging.

The `model.py` file (updated at 6:28:45 PM) contains functions for loading a YOLOv8 object detection model (`load_model`), converting images to different formats (`_to_numpy_bgr`), retrieving the model's label map (`get_label_map`), and performing inference (`predict_image_labels_json`). The `predict_image_labels_json` function processes images, runs YOLOv8 inference, and returns detection results as a JSON string.  This function includes several print statements for debugging purposes, showing class IDs, confidence intervals, bounding box coordinates, and labels.  There's also a `# TODO implement robust logic for only returning the best result` comment, indicating further work is needed to optimize the output.  The code includes mechanisms for managing CPU threads, likely for performance optimization on a Raspberry Pi.  Both files extensively use error handling (`try...except` blocks) for robust operation.


## 8:19:37 PM
The log shows development of an image inference server using Flask and the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model.  The key changes are focused on `model.py` and `server_receive_image.py`.

**`model.py` (8/31/2025, 6:50:07 PM):** This initial commit defines functions to load a YOLOv8 model (`load_model`), convert images to different formats (`_to_numpy_bgr`), get the label map from the model (`get_label_map`), and perform inference and return detections (`predict_image_labels`). The `predict_image_labels` function initially returns a list of all detections.

**`server_receive_image.py` (8/31/2025, 6:50:20 PM):** This commit sets up the Flask server. It includes endpoints for image upload (`/upload`), annotation retrieval (`/retrieve_annotations`), image stitching (`/stitch_images`), serving uploaded files (`/uploads/<path:filename>`), and displaying a gallery (`/view`).  The `/upload` endpoint uses the `model.py` functions to perform inference, draw bounding boxes on the image, and save both the original and annotated images.  The server handles image processing using OpenCV and PIL.

**`model.py` (8/31/2025, 6:56:08 PM):**  A significant change occurs here. The `predict_image_labels` function is modified to return only the *best* detection (highest confidence score) instead of all detections.  This simplifies the server's response.

**`server_receive_image.py` (8/31/2025, 6:56:55 PM and 8/31/2025, 6:59:05 PM):** These commits reflect the changes in `model.py`. The server is updated to handle the change in the return type of `predict_image_labels`, now expecting a dictionary representing a single detection instead of a list. A minor bug fix is also included in the last commit, handling the case where `annotated` might be None more robustly in the return statement.

In summary, the development process involved initial setup of model loading, inference, and server endpoints, followed by a refinement to improve the efficiency of the inference results by only returning the highest confidence detection.  The server uses timestamps to manage filenames and organizes uploaded and annotated images into separate folders.  There's a consistent use of OpenCV and PIL for image manipulation throughout the code.
