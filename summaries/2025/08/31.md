# Activity Summary for 8/31/2025

## 10:55:53 AM
The log shows development of an image inference server.  `draw_bounding_box.py` underwent several revisions between 10:06 AM and 10:41 AM, primarily focusing on refining the drawing of bounding boxes and associated labels onto images. Initially, the code handled multiple bounding boxes; however, by 10:41 AM, it was simplified to handle only a single bounding box at a time.

The `server_receive_image.py` file was significantly altered between 10:17 AM and 10:55 AM.  The key changes involved improving image handling (reading all bytes at once instead of using streams) and handling prediction results. Early versions contained commented-out code, showing an iterative development process.  Around 10:31 AM, the `get_label_map` function was integrated from the `model.py` file, improving label management in bounding box drawing.  Crucially, at 10:54 AM and 10:55 AM, error handling was added to gracefully manage cases where no objects were detected in an image.  The server saves both original and annotated images to `uploads` and `results` folders respectively.

The `model.py` file was updated at 10:29 AM, introducing the `predict_image_labels_json` function that performs YOLOv8 inference and returns a JSON list of detected objects, each with class ID, label, confidence, and bounding box coordinates.  The helper functions `_to_numpy_bgr` (for image format conversion) and `get_label_map` (to get the class labels from the model) were added or improved in this update.  The model loading function also included a warmup step for better performance.
