# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 11:00:31 AM
The log shows a single code modification on August 29th, 2025, at 10:43:05 AM.  The `model.py` file was updated to include a Python dictionary called `names_to_id`. This dictionary maps string names (representing possibly alphabet letters and directional arrows) to integer IDs. The IDs appear to be sequentially assigned, with a gap between alphabet letters and other symbols.


## 1:39:06 PM
The codebase underwent several revisions on August 29, 2025, focusing on the `model.py` and `main.py` files.  The primary changes involved refining the object detection inference and enhancing the main application's functionality.

**model.py:**

The `model.py` file initially contained functions for loading a YOLOv8 model (`load_model`), converting images to BGR format (`_to_numpy_bgr`), and performing inference with output as a dictionary (`predict_image`).

A significant update at 12:50:01 PM introduced a new function, `predict_image_labels_json`. This function processes inference results to output a JSON string mapping detected labels to their corresponding IDs, using a custom mapping (`names_to_id`) or falling back to the model's class ID if a label is not found in the custom mapping. This change required importing the `json` library.  A further minor update at 12:50:10 PM added `import json` to the imports.  No functional changes were made.

**main.py:**

The `main.py` file evolved over several commits. Initially (12:53:07 PM), it used `predict_image` from `model.py` to process frames from a Raspberry Pi Camera, printing detection summaries and optionally saving annotated images.

The next significant change (12:56:23 PM) replaced `predict_image` with `predict_image_labels_json`, reflecting the changes in `model.py`.  The output format remained largely the same in terms of printed summary information.

Further updates at 12:59:26 PM and 1:00:10 PM improved the main application by introducing functions for camera initialization (`init_camera`) and adding a model warmup step.  The `warmup` function was added or altered. At 1:00:10 PM, the `warmup` function call was commented out. The output was changed to print a JSON string to standard output instead of a summary.  The frame format changed from RGB to BGR.

The final revision at 1:38:24 PM introduced command-line argument parsing using `argparse`, allowing for configurable settings like camera resolution, framerate, and inference parameters.  It also added a `run_once` function for single-frame capture and processing and the `as_json_str` function to ensure that output is always a JSON string. The main loop now captures frames in BGR format, directly suitable for OpenCV processing.  The optional saving of annotated images is also commented out in this version.


Throughout the development, the inference size (`IMGSZ`) was consistently set to 416 or used as a parameter, showing a focus on optimizing performance for the Raspberry Pi.  The `predict_image_labels_json` function shows a clear intention to map detected objects to specific IDs for further processing.


## 2:39:04 PM
The log shows development of a client-server system for image inference.  The `client.py` file, first modified at 2:12:06 PM, captures images using a Raspberry Pi camera, encodes them as JPEGs, and sends them to a server for prediction via a POST request to `http://192.168.42.29:8000/predict`.  At 2:38:03 PM, this client was updated to send requests to a new port, `http://192.168.42.29:5000/predict`.

The `laptop_server.py` file underwent several revisions between 2:31:47 PM and 2:36:37 PM.  Initially, it used a YOLO model loaded from `"./best.pt"` (2:31:47 PM), then changed to `"../best.pt"` (2:32:28 PM), and finally reverted to `"./best.pt"` (2:36:14 PM & 2:36:37 PM).  The server's error handling and response were significantly improved between 2:31:47 PM and 2:36:14 PM.  The initial version only had a `/health` endpoint, while the final version included robust error handling for missing files and image decode failures, returning appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 400, 200).  The final version also used `Response` object for returning JSON. The server was also modified to bind to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from other devices.  The consistent element throughout the changes to `laptop_server.py` is the use of the Ultralytics YOLO model for image prediction.
